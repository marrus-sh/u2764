			This post is the second in a series of posts chronicling
				my personal history of involvement with the fringe
				development scene on Mastodon, detailing the
				origins of the movement, and touching on a number
				of larger cultural developments and trends taking
				place in the Mastodon communit<span class="OPTION"
				>{<span class="CASE">y</span>|<span class="CASE"
				>ies</span>}</span> more broadly.
			<strong class="MARK"><dfn>Fringe development</dfn> is my
				term for the development work (research; design;
				coding) taking place on forks and individual
				instances of Mastodon, <em>without</em> the
				intention of sending that work upstream, and
				without mainstream acknowledgment or
				recognition.</strong>
			Increasingly, as Mastodon as a project grows, I believe
				that it is this development work that happens <i
				class="SO-CALLED">on the fringes</i> that will
				shape the future of the software.

			<h2>Laboratory/Labcoat</h2>
			<p>
				When we started work on Ardipithecus, there were no
					illusions about the fact that a fork of
					Mastodon was <strong class="MARK">unlikely to
					be an overnight success.</strong>
				Unlike the fediverse today, the fear <strong
					class="MARK">wasn't lack of instance
					adoption</strong>&#x2014;our single flagship
					instance would have been more than enough to
					compete with Mastodon's single flagship
					instance in that respect&#x2014;<strong
					class="MARK">but of lack of users.</strong>
				For both cultural and technical reasons, Mastodon
					users were <strong class="MARK">unlikely to
					move away from <a
					href="https://mastodon.social/"
					>mastodon.social</a></strong> in favour of an
					independent instance&#x2014;be it <a
					href="https://luci.city/">luci.city</a> or
					anywhere else.
				We <strong class="MARK">needed a breakout
					feature</strong> that would encourage folks to
					make the switch.
			</p>
			<p>
				The feature we decided on was a <strong
					class="MARK">custom frontend,</strong>
					with enhanced customization features and
					a more user&#x2010;friendly interface.
				Mastodon's existing frontend was <strong
					class="MARK">sorely lacking in customization
					facilities</strong> and had the look and
					feel of a somewhat&#x2010;less&#x2010;capable
					TweetDeck clone.
				For Ardipithecus, we wanted a <strong class="MARK"
					>clearer, more distinctive design</strong>
					which could be <strong class="MARK">easily
					adapted by instance administrators</strong> to
					fit their site's overall theme and character.

					Testing Different Backgrounds on
						Labcoat/Ardipithecus
						<em>[interactive]</em>
					<p>
						One thing that was distinctly lacking on
							early Mastodon was any kind of art
							scene.
						An idea that I had during Labcoat
							development was to use the site
							background as a showcase for
							Mastodon(/Ardipithecus) artists, to
							help gain them exposure and make
							them easier to find.
						In an ideal world (one where we had
							a stable revenue stream),
							participating artists would have
							been compensated for their efforts.
					</p>
					<p>
						The tests above use public&#x2010;domain
							images taken from Flickr.

				I named this frontend <a
					href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/labcoat"
					><i>Labcoat</i></a>, built on top of a
					Mastodon API framework that I'd created,
					called <a
					href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/laboratory"
					><i>Laboratory</i></a>.
				Mastodon's frontend was <strong class="MARK"
					>messy,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>difficult to remix,</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">had a steep learning
					curve.</strong>
				My hope with Laboratory/Labcoat <strong
					class="MARK">was to make Mastodon development
					easier</strong> and <strong class="MARK">more
					accessible</strong> to newcomers.
				Both technologies were written in Literate
					CoffeeScript.

					Screenshots of Labcoat's Compose Menu
						<em>[interactive]</em>
					<p>
						One of the design principles for Labcoat
							was that every button have a clear
							text label, as seen in the first of
							these early development snapshots.
						Labcoat was also designed with a
							<i class="SO-CALLED">compact
							mode</i>, in which these labels were
							turned off, as seen in the second.

			<p>
				While Mastodon provides <strong class="MARK"
					>consistent appearances and branding</strong>
					across all of its instances, our hope with
					Ardipithecus was to place interface styling in
					the hands of local administrators and, to the
					extent feasable at the time, users.
				Labcoat was a <i class="SO-CALLED">serverless</i>
					web application, which meant that hosting your
					own was <strong class="MARK">as simple as
					forking the code</strong> and publishing to
					GitHub Pages.
				I <a href="
https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/654">opened a Pull
					Request</a> (which was merged) for a minimal
					API for <strong class="MARK">conveying
					instance information</strong>&#x2014;this is
					now <code>/api/v1/instances</code
					>&#x2014;which was used by Labcoat to set the
					site title and links.
				I also <a href="
https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/669">opened a larger
					Issue</a> for conveying more in&#x2010;depth
					information&#x2014;which <strong class="MARK"
					>did not find support.</strong>

			<h2>Upstream MastoDev</h2>
			<p>
				Assuming we <em>were</em> successful with our fork
					of Mastodon, we <strong class="MARK">knew that
					we would never wholly capture</strong> the
					Fediverse ecosystem as&#x2010;a&#x2010;whole.
				We saw this as <strong class="MARK">a good
					thing:</strong> Mastodon was (and is) the
					Internet Explorer of&#x2014;at the
					time&#x2014;OStatus implementations,
					developing with <strong class="MARK">little
					regard for interoperability</strong> due to
					its dominance of the ecosystem, and <strong
					class="MARK">we had no interest</strong> in
					securing this position for ourselves.
				But it left open <strong class="MARK">an ethical
					dilemma:</strong>
				If we were to develop a feature which <strong
					class="MARK">greatly improved the lives of our
					users,</strong> was it right for us to <strong
					class="MARK"><i class="SO-CALLED">hoard</i>
					it for ourselves,</strong> rather than <strong
					class="MARK">send it upstream,</strong> where
					<strong class="MARK">a greater number of users
					could benefit?</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Because we were naïve, we decided that it would
					probably be best if our improvements <strong
					class="MARK">were made available to
					everyone.</strong>
				I worked <strong class="MARK">implementing a number
					of features</strong> to the TootSuite codebase
					in late February, with the hope that, once
					they made it into master, we could <strong
					class="MARK">merge them into Ardipithecus
					proper</strong> as part of our regular
					updates.

				Mastodon development at this time was still
					<strong class="MARK">largely a one&#x2010;man
					affair</strong> with <strong class="MARK">very
					little oversight,</strong> which meant that
					<strong class="MARK">interpersonal poltics
					were very <em>very</em> important.</strong>
				Although I was <strong class="MARK">upset with how
					the Mastodon Project had responded to conflict
					in the past</strong>&#x2014;as well as its
					<strong class="MARK">organization,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">development
					practices,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>treatment of contributors,</strong> <strong
					class="MARK">approach to branding,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">lack of mission
					statement,</strong> <strong class="MARK">habit
					of firing from the hip</strong> when it came
					to new features, and <strong class="MARK"
					>tendency not to listen</strong> to the
					concerns of its most marginalized until
					<strong class="MARK"><em>after</em> it was too
					late</strong>&#x2014;and even though I was in
					fact <strong class="MARK">secretly building a
					fork of the software</strong> in response to
					these concerns, I needed to <strong
					class="MARK">publicly maintain an agreeable
					image</strong> so long as I had outstanding
					Pull Requests that I <strong class="MARK">was
					waiting to get merged.</strong>
				This was <em>especially</em> true in the period
					from <time datetime="2017-02-27">27
					February</time>&#x2013;<time
					datetime="2017-03-15">15 March</time>, when I

			<h2>April 2017</h2>
			<p>
				Then, <strong class="MARK"><time datetime="2017-04"
					>April 2017</time> arrived, and everything
					changed.</strong>
				Mastodon went from <strong class="MARK"
					>three&#x2010;plus&#x2010;change
					instances</strong> to <strong class="MARK"
					>over a thousand,</strong> relatively
					overnight.
				Eugen covers the basics in his <a href="
https://medium.com/tootsuite/april-post-mortem-12e3d141878c"><cite
					>April post-mortem</cite></a>, so I'll just
					<strong class="MARK">quote the relevant
					passages</strong> here:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Mastodon caught on on Infosec Twitter, which
						is both huge and influential, and
						(somehow, I do not quite understand how)
						also French Twitter.
					[…]
					Think explosion of users from <mark
						>20,000</mark> to <mark>42,000</mark>
						in the span of two days.
				</p>
				<p>
					[…]
				</p>
				<p>
					At the time of writing, the Mastodon network
						includes more than <mark>486,767
						users</mark> spread out among more than a
						<mark>1,212 instances.</mark>
					That’s how far we’ve come.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				This resulted in <strong class="MARK">two major
					changes</strong> in my life.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK"><strong>Thing one.</strong
					></strong>
				The Ardipithecus project was <strong class="MARK"
					>obsoleted overnight,</strong> as <strong
					class="MARK">thousands of instances and admins
					across the globe</strong>, all combining their
					efforts, did a much better job of <strong
					class="MARK">removing social moderation power
					from <a href="https://mastodon.social"
					>mastodon.social</a>'s hands</strong> than we
					ever could.
				Of course, the <strong class="MARK">problems of
					development governance</strong> were <strong
					class="MARK">yet to be solved,</strong> but
					the <strong class="MARK">game had now
					changed</strong>&#x2014;fork success would be
					<strong class="MARK">measured by instance
					count</strong> as much as it was <strong
					class="MARK">in users</strong> for the
					forseeable future.
				With the April influx came a number of <strong
					class="MARK">new developers sensitive to user
					issues</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>willing to work on features</strong> for
					them&#x2014;developers who had <strong
					class="MARK">probably been working in React
					and Redux for longer than two months.</strong>
				I was <strong class="MARK">more than happy to let
					them take the reins.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				This wasn't to say I stopped developing Mastodon
					projects completely, but my focus had shifted
					<strong class="MARK">away from big codebases
					for everyone</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>towards personal projects and niche
					interests.</strong>

			<p>
				Well.
				Although the influx of new users was <strong
					class="MARK">good for me personally,</strong>
					its impact on others still involved with
					Mastodon development&#x2014;and who I
					maintained connections to via close
					friends&#x2014;was <strong class="MARK"
					>less&#x2010;than&#x2010;grand.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the beginning, Mastodon development had been
					<strong class="MARK">driven by its queer
					communities and users,</strong> many of whom
					<strong class="MARK">didn't feel safe on other
					platforms</strong> and were <strong
					class="MARK">wedded to the site.</strong>
				It was, at first, <strong class="MARK">a happy
					marriage</strong>&#x2014;Mastodon <strong
					class="MARK">got a userbase</strong> and Masto
					queers got <strong class="MARK">a space to
					call their own</strong>&#x2014;but after the
					April influx <strong class="MARK">this balance
					had been upset.</strong>
				Queer voices were, or were in danger of,
					<strong class="MARK">being replaced by cis
					white techbros</strong> from the sizeäble
					infosec demographic which had initiated the
					surge.
				There was, and still is, <strong class="MARK">a
					real fear</strong> of Mastodon <strong
					class="MARK">turning the way of every other
					social media platform</strong> now that there
					was <strong class="MARK">a suitable straight
					white base</strong> to sustain it into the
					future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lots of people saw this happening, and were
					worried about it, but at the time most of
					the folks close enough to be aware <strong
					class="MARK">were themselves knees&#x2010;deep
					in Mastodon development politics</strong> and
					<strong class="MARK">couldn't really afford to
					throw stones</strong>&#x2014;the <strong
					class="MARK">same situation I had been
					in</strong> before switching accounts.
				I, on the other hand, had <strong class="MARK"><em
					>already</em> positioned myself as an
					outsider,</strong> and had the chops
					and&#x2014;as of recently&#x2014;the audience
					to <strong class="MARK">apply appropriate
					pressure.</strong>
				The goal was to <strong class="MARK">get queer
					oversight into the Mastodon development
					process</strong> through the <strong
					class="MARK">hiring of a non&#x2010;cishet
					Project Manager.</strong>
				(Ideally, we would have aimed for a
					non&#x2010;white Project Manager as well,
					but it seemed like the chances of that
					happening were already
					slim&#x2010;to&#x2010;none.)

					A response to “Mourning Mastodon,” by the author
				</p>
			</a>
			<p>
				The answer to this question, which I attempted to
					make clear in my <em>own</em> response to the
					piece, was that <cite>Mourning Mastodon</cite>
					was a <strong class="MARK">political essay
					with a particular goal,</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">calling out Masto queers for
					their racism</strong> wasn't going to stop
					Masto <em>development</em> from <strong
					class="MARK">going the way of the
					techbro.</strong>
				And, in all honesty, I was <strong class="MARK">a
					little miffed at the time,</strong> because
					the whole <em>reason</em> I had <strong
					class="MARK">switched accounts</strong> and
					<strong class="MARK">made this entire
					alternate persona</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">devoted countless hours to
					learning Ruby and React</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">how to do Mastodon
					development</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>cut off contact with most of my
					friends</strong> was <strong class="MARK"
					><em>because</em> of Mastodon's racism
					problem,</strong> and so having people <strong
					class="MARK">arriving fresh from
					Twitter,</strong> <strong class="MARK">not
					bothering to learn any of that
					history,</strong> but <strong class="MARK"
					>throwing stones at <em>me</em> for not doing
					it justice</strong> felt a tad unfair
					(especially when I could just have easily have
					not brought it up in the first place and
					erased the whole thing&#x2014;not that <em
					>that</em> would have helped anyone).
			</p>
			<p>
				The truth, of course, was that I <strong
					class="MARK"><em>hadn't</em> done the issue
					justice;</strong> it would remain <strong
					class="MARK">completely unchronicled</strong>
					for the following 16&#x2010;plus months until
					the publishing of the first post in this
					series.
				Furthermore, although the (mostly
					temporary&#x2014;at least for those friends
					who weren't lowkey racist) loss of friendships
					and social networks resulting from switching
					accounts, and the (very much
					not&#x2010;recoverable) time sunk into
					learning Mastodon technologies <strong
					class="MARK">were real sacrifices made on my
					part,</strong> the reason <em
					>why</em> I had been able to stick around and
					see this work through <strong class="MARK">had
					a good deal to do</strong> with my being
					<strong class="MARK">white,</strong> <strong
					class="MARK">trans,</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">relatively inconspicuous</strong>
					(despite, sometimes, my best intentions).
				So, <strong class="MARK">such responses were
					reasonable</strong>&#x2014;although I lacked
					the means to do much better at the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="PARENTHETICAL">(NB:
				Of course, literally every other white Mastodon
					user was also to blame for not owning up to
					this history or, geez, writing it down.
				People been asking for <em>over a year</em>
					now&#x2014;and I <em>know</em> because
					<cite>Mourning Mastodon</cite>, my propoganda
					piece with clear and glaring flaws when it
					comes to actually providing a historical
