			This post is the first in a series of posts chronicling
				my personal history of involvement with the fringe
				development scene on Mastodon, detailing the
				origins of the movement, and touching on a number
				of larger cultural developments and trends taking
				place in the Mastodon communit<span class="OPTION"
				>{<span class="CASE">y</span>|<span class="CASE"
				>ies</span>}</span> more broadly.
			<strong class="MARK"><dfn>Fringe development</dfn> is my
				term for the development work (research; design;
				coding) taking place on forks and individual
				instances of Mastodon, <em>without</em> the
				intention of sending that work upstream, and
				without mainstream acknowledgment or
				recognition.</strong>
			Increasingly, as Mastodon as a project grows, I believe
				that it is this development work that happens <i
				class="SO-CALLED">on the fringes</i> that will
				shape the future of the software.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to Mastodon's nature as a GPL&#x2010;licensed,
				open&#x2010;source project, TootSuite upstream has
				the ability to profit off of fringe development
				work with little in the way of compensation or
				acknowledgment, <strong class="MARK">obscuring the
				origins of its features, and making the project
				appear as the singular creation of one enlightened
				organization&#x2014;or developer.</strong>
			This could not be further from the truth.
			<strong class="MARK">Acknowledging and recording the
				troubled history of the Mastodon software is
				essential</strong> to prevent the narratives of
				these <em>other</em> developers&#x2014;frequently,
				marginalized actors doing important work for their
				communities&#x2014;from being lost.
		</p>
		<p>
			For those of you who arrived at this post from somewhere
				else, my name is KIBI Gô, and for the past year or
				so I've been one of the most prolific fringe
				developers of the Mastodon software.
			My curriculum vitae in this respect mostly consists of
				my work for <a
				href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/"
				>GlitchSoc</a>, the first successful Mastodon fork,
				where I was the primary, and frequently
				full&#x2010;time, developer for the period from
				roughly <time datetime="2017-06-20">20 June
				2017</time>&#x2013;<time datetime="2018-02-20">20
				February 2018</time> (8 months).
			Aside from GlitchSoc proper, I have been involved in
				such Mastodon&#x2010;adjacent projects as
				<a href="
https://github.com/marrus-sh/mastodon/commit/69e2d7ff7cf744c44f9f0c42ba3c271687a2daa7

			(Most of these names will probably be unfamiliar to you,
				if you didn't follow me at the time I was working
				on them.)
		</p>
		<p>
			This post is intended as a retrospective of the past
				nineteen&#x2010;plus months, starting with
				Mastodon's February 2017 schism, and going up
				through the present&#x2010;day, chronicling my
				time working within the Mastodon community and with
				the Mastodon software.
			For those of you who <em>have</em> been following along
				with me on this journey, it is intended to offer
				some clarity as to where all of these ideas and
				projects have gone, and what my plans are moving
				forward.
			For those of you who haven't, I'm hoping it will shed
				some light on Mastodon's early history and the
				forces and factors which have made it what it is
				today.
		</p>
		<p>
			I first joined Mastodon on <a href="
https://mastodon.social/@marrus_sh/156773"><time
				datetime="2016-11-22">22 November 2016</time></a>.
			I've already touched upon the climate of Mastodon in
				those early few months in my previous
				retrospective, <a href="
https://medium.com/@alliethehart/gameingers-are-dead-and-so-is-mastodon-705b535ed616
"><cite>Mourning Mastodon</cite></a>, and I honestly don't have much
				more to add.
			(<cite>Mourning Mastodon</cite>, and its political
				context, will be discussed in further detail later
				in this series.)
			Instead, I want to start with the moment when <strong
				class="MARK">that initial cohesion met its first
				major stumbling block,</strong> when <strong
				class="MARK">Mastodon stopped being
				singular,</strong> and when <strong class="MARK">I
				first found myself getting involved as something
				more than a user.</strong>

				This story begins, as perhaps it ought, with

					>significant,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>controversial,</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">distinctive</strong> feature:
					the <strong class="MARK">Content Warning
					(CW).</strong>
				As a technological feature, Mastodon received
					Content Warnings <a href="
https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/460">on <time
					datetime="2017-01-24">24 January
					2017</time></a>, roughly 19&#x2013;20 months
					ago, at time of writing.
				In truth, <strong class="MARK">Mastodon already
					<em>had</em> Content Warnings</strong> prior
					to this, but they looked like so:

				That is, they consisted of a <strong class="MARK"
					>plaintext description</strong> followed by
					<strong class="MARK"><a
					href="https://rot13.com/">ROT13</a
					>&#x2010;encoded text.</strong>
				These were used <em>primarily</em> for
					lewds&#x2014;sometimes posted straight to the
					public timeline&#x2014;but by the end of
					January they were prevalent enough
					in&#x2010;general that <a href="
https://web.archive.org/web/20171023090328/https://swaldie.github.io/Mastodon-Guide/
">Mastodon guides of that era</a> needed to explicitly tell new users
					how to process them.
				There were concerns from the development community
					that <strong class="MARK">the massive amounts
					of ROT13 on the site would drive away new
					users,</strong> and this was <strong
					class="MARK">one of the driving forces between
					CW adoption.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				To be clear on these points:
			</p>
			<ul class="PARAGRAPH">
				<li>
					CWs are a feature <strong class="MARK"
						>developed by the community,</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					They <strong class="MARK">already had
						widespread adoption</strong> before a
						line of code was committed to the
						Mastodon repository, and
				</li>
				<li>
					The technological incorporation of CWs into
						the software was aimed, among other
						things, at making them <strong
						class="MARK">easier and more
						accessible</strong> for people to use,
						especially for outsiders.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">Mastodon culture moved <em
					>incredibly</em> fast</strong> in those days,
					and by the time <time datetime="2017-02"
					>February</time> rolled around, there were
					already a set of community practices
					in&#x2010;place dictating when and where they
					should be used.
				These were largely carried over from the ROT13
					days, but were enforced more stringently now
					that adding a CW was as easy as clicking a
					button.
			</p>
			<p>
				That said, the transition from ROT13 to
					built&#x2010;in CW <strong class="MARK">wasn't
					entirely without turmoil.</strong>
				<i class="SO-CALLED">CW&#x2010;jokes</i
					>&#x2014;where the content warning was the
					setup and the body of the toot was the
					punchline&#x2014;existed from the very first
					day, and were frequently used by people
					testing out the feature for the first time.
				Memes like <i class="SO-CALLED">SOME(BODY)</i> and
					<i class="SO-CALLED">IT'S BEEN</i> also took
					no time at all to surface, and made CWs into a
					core part of Mastodon culture.
				Even so, <strong class="MARK">there was a segment
					of the population who thought that this was a
					mis&#x2010;use of the feature,</strong> that
					CWs should be used as trigger warnings
					exclusively, and that <i class="SO-CALLED"
					>CW&#x2010;jokes</i> were trivializing the
					trauma of those who depended on them for safe
					navigation online.

				<strong class="MARK"><q>CW politics</q> was a
					refrain which was taken up <em>very</em>
					quickly</strong> by a number of passionate
					users&#x2014;anyone who is on Mastodon today
					is likely familiar with this norm.
				Remember that this was <strong class="MARK">just
					after the inauguration</strong> of the 45th
					President of the United States of America,
					Donald J. Trump, and that much of Mastodon's
					initial base was <strong class="MARK">queer
					leftists from Twitter</strong> who joined in
					<time datetime="2016-11">November 2016</time>,
					when post&#x2010;election fervour was at its
					peak.
				It had been a rough political year for all of us,
					and time and space away from the steady
					stream of disheartening news was something
					many sorely needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, early in February, <strong class="MARK"
					>this community standard was
					weaponized,</strong> as white, trans
					users&#x2014;who, for the record, posted
					un&#x2010;CWed trans shit in their timeline
					all the time&#x2014;started <strong
					class="MARK">taking it to the mentions of
					people of colour</strong> whenever the subject
					of race came up.
				It was an incredibly unfair double&#x2010;standard,
					which effectively amounted to white people
					restricting the domain of public discourse to
					only those things which made them feel
					comfortable.
				In an attempt to demonstrate the sillyness of their
					position, I've created a table, reproduced
					below, which lists <strong class="MARK">some
					things that these white randos may or may not
					have responded angrily to</strong> seeing on
					the Public <abbr title="TimeLine">TL</abbr>:

				<p>
					<strong>Sidenote:</strong>
					Mastodon is far from the first instance of
						people using content&#x2010;warning and
						safe&#x2010;space rhetoric to silence
						those at odds with their movement.
					On college campuses, cis white feminists have
						long deployed safe&#x2010;space
						terminology to silence women of colour
						and exclude trans people from their
						movements, just as strong advocates of
						the State of Israel have used it to quell
						discussion of the history and status of
						the Palestinian territories' occupation.
					More recently, alt&#x2010;right organizations
						have attempted (mostly unsuccessfully) to
						co&#x2010;opt safe&#x2010;space rhetoric
						as a means of creäting safe harbours for
						their toxic views.
				</p>
				<p>
					The moral of these incidents is not that
						safe&#x2010;space or
						content&#x2010;warning rhetoric is
						inherently <em>bad</em>, but rather that
						it, like any rhetoric, is indiscriminate,
						and can be deployed by our oppressors
						against us just as easily as we might
						deploy it against them.
					This is nothing new, and we have seen it
						happen time and time again with various
						resistance strategies over the years.
					Of course, the difference is in the
						details&#x2014;a <i class="SO-CALLED"
						>Don't Ask, Don't Tell</i> policy
						forbidding queer users from discussing
						their sexuality outside of a CW isn't
						intended to protect individuals, but
						rather, the status quo.
				</p>
				<p>
					And yes, in a different world, that might very
						well have been the CW policy enforced on
						Mastodon today.

				As a result, it took me a few days to piece
					together what was going on, and most of what I
					learned came secondhand (from people

					<strong>Anecdote:</strong>

			<h2>The Aftermath</h2>
			<p>
				The above narrative is <strong class="MARK"
					>probably not unfamiliar</strong> to many of
					the people of colour on Mastodon today,
					because this shit still happens.
				Mastodon's white users <strong class="MARK">remain
					more sensitive to issues of race</strong> than
					issues of gender, and continue to <strong
					class="MARK">leverage their white
					fragility</strong> in an attempt to silence
					and contain nonwhite voices and complaints.
				Whereäs Mastodon's trans community has largely been
					<strong class="MARK">granted the
					self&#x2010;autonomy to decide</strong> what
					kinds of topics are or aren't acceptable, or
					which do or don't require advance warning,
					with respect to trans issues, for much of its
					history Mastodon's nonwhite communities have
					<strong class="MARK">not had the size or
					leverage</strong> to do the same regarding
					issues of racial injustice.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nevertheless, the landscape of Mastodon today is
					<strong class="MARK">far more open and
					optimistic</strong> with respect to garnering
					change in this area than the Mastodon of
					nineteen months ago ever was.
				At that time, <strong class="MARK"><a href="
https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/3b81baaaaf51ff1c70fb1f865eef07fdb33a5950
">reports didn't even exist yet</a>,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>users were mostly confined to a
					single instance,</strong> and the question of
					<strong class="MARK">when and where and what
					is considered politics</strong> had been
					circulating unresolved since Fidel Castro's
					death on literally the third day after I'd
					joined.
				Consequently, the <i class="SO-CALLED">do
					white people have the right to police
					when and where and how people of colour
					talk about race</i> question blew up to
					encompass a number of other topics, like
					<strong class="MARK"><i class="SO-CALLED">what
					is Mastodon's role as a safe space versus
					communication and organizing platform</i
					>.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				From these questions, <strong class="MARK">two
					broad camps emerged,</strong> and these were
					informed by race and politics&#x2014;but also
					by <strong class="MARK">fundamental
					differences in how people used the
					site.</strong>
				The first camp didn't want <strong class="MARK"
					>anything resembling an uncomfortable
					topic</strong> crossing their
					feeds&#x2014;even and especially during
					community disputes.
				The most sympathetic of these users were folks
					who had <strong class="MARK">active social
					media accounts</strong> on Twitter and other
					platforms, and who used Mastodon as a <strong
					class="MARK">safe&#x2010;space refuge</strong>
					and <strong class="MARK">not as a
					replacement</strong> for other sites:
				<i class="SO-CALLED">I'm <strong class="MARK"
					>already bombarded with politics on
					Twitter;</strong> why should I have to deal
					with it here?</i>
				Of course, there were also those who <strong
					class="MARK">just didn't want their privilege
					challenged.</strong>
				Many of the users in this camp went on to
					<strong class="MARK">serve as the founding
					body for <a href="https://awoo.space/"
					>awoo.space</a></strong> (nothing against
					Awoo), which was registered as a domain on
					<time datetime="2017-02-07">07 February
					2017</time>.

			<h2>Ardipithecus</h2>
			<p>
				After making the light rants quoted above, I
					<strong class="MARK">mostly fell
					silent</strong> on the issue of Mastodon's
					February schism, out of equal parts…
			</p>
			<ul class="PARAGRAPH">
				<li>
					…not wanting to <strong class="MARK">incite
						additional drama.</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					…not wanting to make Mastodon <strong
						class="MARK">any more
						factionalized</strong> or openly hostile
						than it already was.
				</li>
				<li>
					…not <strong class="MARK">feeling it was my
						place to discuss,</strong> as someone who
						had mostly experienced everything from
						the outside.
					(<strong class="MARK">I kept waiting</strong>
						for someone else who was
						better&#x2010;informed to flesh out a
						comprehensive take on the subject.
					But, you know, unlike me, <strong class="MARK"
						>they all had lives.</strong>)
				</li>
				<li>
					…<strong class="MARK">needing to maintain my
						social connections</strong> to <a
						href="https://mastodon.social/"
						>mastodon.social</a>, as they made up my
						<strong class="MARK">sole point of
						access</strong> for any sort of trans
						community or resources.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				And if you have spoken to me about or heard me make
					reference to these events before, you have
					<strong class="MARK">probably noticed my
					reticence</strong> towards going into any sort
					of detail, for some or all of the reasons
					above.
				At the same time, however, <strong class="MARK"
					>underground plans were brewing.</strong>
				The <strong class="MARK">writing was on the
					wall</strong> with regard to how the Mastodon
					project would treat its <strong class="MARK"
					>most marginalized users</strong> whenever
					their needs came into conflict with its
					<strong class="MARK">existing </strong
					>(albeït, at the time,
					also&#x2010;quite&#x2010;marginalized)<strong
					class="MARK"> base,</strong> and so
					<a href="https://glitch.social/@KitRedgrave"
					>@KitRedgrave</a> and I almost
					immediately began working on an <strong
					class="MARK">independent fork of the
					software,</strong> codenamed <strong
					class="MARK"><i>Ardipithecus</i>,</strong>
					to liberate the codebase from the questionable
					decisions of its development team.
				This was, to my knowledge, the <strong class="MARK"
					>first serious attempt at forking</strong>
					Mastodon.
				The first commit was made on <a href="
https://github.com/marrus-sh/mastodon/commit/69e2d7ff7cf744c44f9f0c42ba3c271687a2daa7
"><time datetime="2017-02-15">15 February 2017</time></a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the Mastodon Project's biggest failings was
					that it <strong class="MARK">lacked any sort
					of strong mission statement</strong> or
					purpose&#x2014; beyond simply <i
					class="SO-CALLED">replace Twitter</i>.
				Mastodon's rules were a series of prohibitions:
					certain things were not allowed (and they were
					good things to disallow), but there was
					<strong class="MARK">no sense of what the
					project actually stood <em>for</em>.</strong>
				Consequently, when push came to shove, the Mastodon
					project was only willing to react in cases
					where somebody had <i class="SO-CALLED">broken
					the law</i>, and not to proäctively defend its
					users.
				Kit and I agreed that we wanted <strong
					class="MARK">an instance which did things
					differently,</strong> and I drafted a rough
					sketch of five Principles for guiding
					instance management, under the tentative name
					of GLASS<sub>CAFE</sub>.
				After our plans regarding Ardipithecus were more
					firmly formalized, we decided on LuciCity
					as the final name for our instance.
				(It never launched, but Kit did purchase the domain
					name.)

					GLASS<sub>CAFE</sub> initial design sketch
						<em>[interactive]</em>
					<p>
						In the time since this original sketch
							was created, the problems of
							instance and community management
							have been tackled time and time
							again across the fediverse, and a
							number of best&#x2010;practices,
							which may or may not be reflected in
							the above, have emerged.
						At the time in which we were doing this
							work, however, it was all
							unprecedented.
						This was a time when private toots still
							didn't federate&#x2014;and that was
							fine, because everybody lived on
							<a href="https://mastodon.social"
							>mastodon.social</a>.
					</p>

			<p>
				Aside from wanting better community management, we
					also wanted a more <strong class="MARK"
					>flexible</strong>, <strong class="MARK"
					>customizable</strong>, and <strong
					class="MARK">human(e)</strong> software, with
					<strong class="MARK">better documentation and
					standardization</strong> of features, a
					<strong class="MARK">slower, more
					transparent</strong> development process, and
					a <strong class="MARK">more open and
					developer&#x2010;friendly</strong> approach to
					pull requests.
				At the top of our wishlist was the <strong
					class="MARK">splitting of Mastodon's frontend
					and backend,</strong> which we had planned as
					our breakout feature.
				Neither of us liked Mastodon's existing branding,
					and we wanted Ardipithecus to have a look of
					its own.

				Before that February, I had <strong class="MARK"
					>never interacted with React, Redux, or Ruby
					on Rails before,</strong> and the week between
					our decision to fork the software and its
					first commit was mostly spent by me taking the
					crashiest of crash courses.
				Coming into this, I was a Gender Studies major and
					fantasy/romance writer whose experience with
					programming for the web was mostly limited to
					<strong class="MARK">static websites,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">dictionaries for
					fictional languages,</strong> and the <strong
					class="MARK">occasional (bad) HTML5 browser
					game.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				My reasons for bringing up Mastodon's February
					schism aren't simply to stir up drama or to
					show how nothing has really changed.
				<strong class="MARK">This is what got me into
					Mastodon development.</strong>
