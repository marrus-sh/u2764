			This post is the third in a series of posts chronicling
				my personal history of involvement with the fringe
				development scene on Mastodon, detailing the
				origins of the movement, and touching on a number
				of larger cultural developments and trends taking
				place in the Mastodon communit<span class="OPTION"
				>{<span class="CASE">y</span>|<span class="CASE"
				>ies</span>}</span> more broadly.
			<strong class="MARK"><dfn>Fringe development</dfn> is my
				term for the development work (research; design;
				coding) taking place on forks and individual
				instances of Mastodon, <em>without</em> the
				intention of sending that work upstream, and
				without mainstream acknowledgment or
				recognition.</strong>
			Increasingly, as Mastodon as a project grows, I believe
				that it is this development work that happens <i
				class="SO-CALLED">on the fringes</i> that will
				shape the future of the software.

			<h2>GlitchSoc</h2>
			<p>
				When I published the first chapter of <cite
					>Vague</cite>, I really was hoping to be
					<strong class="MARK">done with Mastodon
					development</strong> for a while.
				It <strong class="MARK">hadn't gotten me
					anywhere,</strong> <strong class="MARK">hadn't
					made much of a difference</strong> to the
					software, and <strong class="MARK">didn't seem
					to be sustainable.</strong>
				I wanted to <strong class="MARK">refocus my time on
					my passions</strong>&#x2014;writing,
					especially, and on making things, and bringing
					light into the world.
				<cite>Vague</cite> was experimental, but the hope
					was that it would <strong class="MARK">help me
					build the chops</strong> (and&#x2014;although
					it was a longshot&#x2014;the audience) to
					<strong class="MARK">pursue writing more
					actively</strong> in the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">All of that got pushed
					aside</strong> a few weeks later, however,
					when <strong class="MARK"><a
					href="https://glitch.social/@bea">@bea</a>
					made me an offer I couldn't refuse.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">The context:</strong>
				After publishing <cite>Mourning Mastodon</cite>, I
					<strong class="MARK">made good on my
					efforts</strong> to stay out of
					MastoDev&#x2014;at least, the Mastodon
					development that was happening <strong
					class="MARK"><em>at that time</em></strong>.
				What I <em>would</em> do, however, was <strong
					class="MARK">post little <i class="SO-CALLED"
					>historical note</i> threads to my Mastodon
					account,</strong> divulging the <strong
					class="MARK">history of various
					features</strong> and <strong class="MARK">how
					they had sprung into being</strong
					>&#x2014;something which <strong class="MARK"
					>doesn't get talked about enough,</strong>
					imo, and something which I <strong
					class="MARK">still do from time to
					time.</strong>
				These threads <strong class="MARK">attracted <a
					href="https://glitch.social/@bea">@bea</a>'s
					attention</strong>&#x2014;although at the time
					I mostly identified her (perhaps rightfully)
					as <strong class="MARK">part of the
					glitch/<wbr />tech/<wbr />hacker
					crowd,</strong> which I <strong class="MARK"
					>wasn't (amn't) really a part of</strong> and
					<strong class="MARK">didn't (don't) really
					understand.</strong>
				Apparently (<a href="
https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/commit/ea785d0bafd75f6b7ce3d4139642c2bad688784b#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8
">looking at GitHub</a>), there were already <strong class="MARK">the
					beginnings of an attempt</strong> at <strong
					class="MARK">implementing some glitch
					hacks</strong> onto Mastodon in these early
					days, and these were completely <strong
					class="MARK">not on my radar,</strong>
					probably for this reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				In any case, during the course of my postings I had
					<strong class="MARK">noticed there was a
					discrepancy</strong> between the way in which
					characters were counted in the Mastodon
					frontend, and the way in which they were
					counted in the backend's status validator.
				(This sort of minute detail is an <em
					>incredibly</em> <i class="SO-CALLED">me</i>
					thing to notice and look into, as those of you
					who know me probably know well.)
				Because <strong class="MARK">I'm a Unicode sort of
					gal,</strong> and <strong class="MARK">was
					curious,</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>familiar with the Mastodon codebase,</strong>
					I <strong class="MARK">tracked down the exact
					lines</strong> in Mastodon's source which were
					causing the problem.
				<strong class="MARK">I <a href="
https://icosahedron.website/@u2764/2151749">posted these findings</a
					></strong> to my Mastodon account, and <a
					href="https://glitch.social/@bea">@bea</a>
					<strong class="MARK">offered to let me try
					patching it live</strong> on her development
					instance, <a href="https://dev.glitch.social"
					>dev.glitch.social</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the private discussions with <a
					href="https://glitch.social/@bea">@bea</a>
					which followed, I explained that I had
					<strong class="MARK">actually stopped doing
					Mastodon development,</strong> given my past
					history with it and the way it had treated its
					queer contributors.
				She responded that <strong class="MARK">she had
					heard that a lot,</strong> <strong
					class="MARK">thought it was sad,</strong> and
					<strong class="MARK">was actually trying to
					pull together a fork</strong> of the software,
					as a space for <strong class="MARK">queer
					devs</strong> who had been <strong
					class="MARK">pushed out of mainline Mastodon
					development.</strong>
				<strong class="MARK">Her focus,</strong> she said,
					<strong class="MARK">was on trans
					women,</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>creating a safe place</strong> where <strong
					class="MARK">their contributions would be
					heard.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				I'll admit&#x2014;<strong class="MARK">I had a
					moment of hesitation.</strong>
				After cis white men, techy trans women are one of
					the <strong class="MARK">largest and most
					influential demographics</strong> on Mastodon,
					and already had a <strong class="MARK">long
					and established history</strong> of
					contributions both <strong class="MARK">to the
					Mastodon culture</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">to its codebase.</strong>
				Although I was vocal about <strong class="MARK"
					>ensuring these contributions received the
					recognition they deserved,</strong> and
					<strong class="MARK">concerned about the
					long&#x2010;term viability of trans Mastodon
					development</strong> (see <cite>Mourning
					Mastodon</cite> lol), trans women were <strong
					class="MARK">far from the top</strong> of my
					list of <strong class="MARK"><i
					class="SO-CALLED">underrepresented groups in
					need of support</i>.</strong>
				I didn't (don't) think that Mastodon's
					<strong class="MARK"
					>less&#x2010;than&#x2010;stellar
					history</strong> of responding to
					race&#x2010;related issues would be resolved
					by <strong class="MARK">anything other than a
					significant nonwhite presence in the
					development staff</strong>&#x2014;and <em
					>that</em>, far more than Mastodon's handling
					of queer issues, was <strong class="MARK">what
					had gotten me into Mastodon
					development.</strong>
				A trans&#x2010;dedicated fork could well end up
					<strong class="MARK">in tension with those
					goals</strong> if&#x2014;as historically had
					been the case on Mastodon&#x2014;those trans
					women <strong class="MARK">trended
					overwhelmingly towards being white.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand:
				<strong class="MARK">How many major
					user&#x2010;facing open&#x2010;source
					projects</strong> are
					significantly&#x2010;to&#x2010;entirely
					<strong class="MARK">owned, operated, and
					dedicated to trans women?</strong>
				For a time at least, <strong class="MARK">that was
					GlitchSoc.</strong>
				<strong class="MARK">It was a big deal,</strong>
					and I <strong class="MARK">couldn't exactly
					say no.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Needless to say, <strong class="MARK"><cite
					>Vague</cite> got placed on hold.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				(<span class="PARENTHETICAL">NB:
				GlitchSoc is now over a year old, and has undergone
					a number of internal changes during that time,
					for a variety of reasons (some of which I will
					get into later in this series).
				Although we might be able to point you in the
					direction of current active staff and
					developers, neither <a
					href="https://glitch.social/@bea">@bea</a> nor
					I are currently involved with development or
					management of the fork in any significant,
					day&#x2010;to&#x2010;day way.
				There are probably better people to approach if you
					want to know what the status of the fork is
					right now!

			<h2>Summer of Go</h2>
			<p>
				Although my early work with GlitchSoc <strong
					class="MARK">received a fairly wide amount of
					acclaim,</strong> it was, in essence, <strong
					class="MARK">a week's worth of hacks,</strong>
					and I still <strong class="MARK">had my sights
					set on other things.</strong>
				I <strong class="MARK">visited the beach,</strong>
					and a friend and I <strong class="MARK"
					>chatted about making a visual novel
					engine</strong> in Qt+Go, tentatively titled
					<strong class="MARK"><a
					href="https://github.com/kirin-vn"><i>Kirin
					VN</i></a>.</strong>
				I spent a week or two playing around in Go and
					learning the language&#x2014;one thing in its
					favour, Go is <em>incredibly</em> fast to
					learn.
			</p>
			<p>
				Go's channels seemed <strong class="MARK"
					>incredibly well&#x2010;suited to
					feed&#x2010;based applications,</strong> and
					so I toyed around with creating a Mastodon API
					library in the language.
				It was titled <strong class="MARK"><a
					href="https://github.com/ratatootille"><i
					>Ratatootille</i></a></strong>, and all the
					components were given culinary names, like <i
					>Mirepoix</i> and <i>Roux</i>.
				I was <strong class="MARK">frustrated with the lack
					of native apps</strong> for Mastodon on
					desktop platforms, and saw Ratatootille as a
					potential first step to getting there.
				(Ratatootille was never finished&#x2014;my time
					got taken up with other projects before I had
					the chance to bring it to a working state.)
			</p>
			<p>
				As I developed these projects over the summer, I
					<strong class="MARK">remained involved in the
					Glitch community,</strong> moving my personal
					account over to <a
					href="https://glitch.social/@kibi">@kibi<wbr
					/>@glitch.social</a> and leaving my
					Icosahedron one open for more political
					conversations.
				(For a while&#x2014;after all my involvement with
					Mastodon politics and community drama,
					however, <strong class="MARK">I really needed
					a break,</strong> and so that account
					gradually fell out of use.)
				I <strong class="MARK">continued to hold
					conversations</strong> about the state of
					Mastodon and the potential for new features on
					the GlitchSoc Discord, and <strong
					class="MARK">added polish</strong> to the
					various things I had already implemented,
					slowly converting them from quick hacks into
					more fully&#x2010;developed features.

                                       To my lovely code maintainers,

  The syntax recognized by the Mastodon frontend for its bio metadata
  feature is a subset of that provided by the YAML 1.2 specification.
  In particular, Mastodon recognizes metadata which is provided as an
  implicit YAML map, where each key-value pair takes up only a single
  line (no multi-line values are permitted). To simplify the level of
  processing required, Mastodon metadata frontmatter has been limited
  to only allow those characters in the <code>`c-printable`</code> set, as defined
  by the YAML 1.2 specification, instead of permitting those from the
  <code>`nb-json`</code> characters inside double-quoted strings like YAML proper.
    <small>¶</small> It is important to note that Mastodon only borrows the <em>*syntax*</em>
  of YAML, not its semantics. This is to say, Mastodon won't make any
  attempt to interpret the data it receives. <code>`true`</code> will not become a
  boolean; <code>`56`</code> will not be interpreted as a number. Rather, each key
  and every value will be read as a string, and as a string they will
  remain. The order of the pairs is unchanged, and any duplicate keys
  are preserved. However, YAML escape sequences will be replaced with
  the proper interpretations according to the YAML 1.2 specification.
    <small>¶</small> The implementation provided below interprets <code>`&lt;br&gt;`</code> as <code>`\n`</code> and
  allows for an open &lt;p&gt; tag at the beginning of the bio. It replaces
  the escaped character entities <code>`&amp;apos;`</code> and <code>`&amp;quot;`</code> with single or
  double quotes, respectively, prior to processing. However, no other
  escaped characters are replaced, not even those which might have an
  impact on the syntax otherwise. These minor allowances are provided
  because the Mastodon backend will insert these things automatically
  into a bio before sending it through the API, so it is important we
  account for them. Aside from this, the YAML frontmatter must be the
  very first thing in the bio, leading with three consecutive hyphen-
  minues (<code>`---`</code>), and ending with the same or, alternatively, instead
  with three periods (<code>`...`</code>). No limits have been set with respect to
  the number of characters permitted in the frontmatter, although one
  should note that only limited space is provided for them in the UI.
    <small>¶</small> The regular expression used to check the existence of, and then
  process, the YAML frontmatter has been split into a number of small
  components in the code below, in the vain hope that it will be much
  easier to read and to maintain. I leave it to the future readers of
  this code to determine the extent of my successes in this endeavor.

  <strong>UPDATE 19 Oct 2017:</strong> We no longer allow character escapes inside our
  double-quoted strings for ease of processing. We now internally use
  the name "ƔAML" in our code to clarify that this is Not Quite YAML.

                                       Sending love + warmth eternal,

				Notably, during this time, the <strong class="MARK"
					>initial steps were taken towards GlitchSoc's
					multiple frontend support.</strong>
				Splitting out the frontend and the backend was
					something I had been passionate about
					<strong class="MARK">since my work with
					Ardipithecus</strong>&#x2014;however, thanks
					to Mastodon switching over to Webpack for
					for asset management, it was now <strong
					class="MARK">possible to support on a
					per&#x2010;user basis.</strong>
				I <strong class="MARK">rewrote significant parts of
					Mastodon's Webpack configuration</strong> and
					created a <a href="
https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/pull/110">first&#x2010;steps
					implementation</a> on <time
					datetime="2017-07-30">30 July 2017</time>,
					then <a href="
https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/pull/155">rewrote it to use YAML
					configuration files</a> on <time
					datetime="2017-09-25">25 September 2017</time
					>.
				During that time, upstream Mastodon <strong
					class="MARK">implemented <a href="
https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/4959">its <em>own</em>
					theming support</a></strong>; however, unlike
					GlitchSoc, these themes were <strong
					class="MARK">limited to switching out
					stylesheets,</strong> not replacing the whole
					frontend.
				I would eventually <a href="
https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/pull/229">add support for this
					method of theming to GlitchSoc as well</a>,
					calling <strong class="MARK"
					>total&#x2010;frontend&#x2010;replacement
					themes <i class="SO-CALLED">flavours</i
					></strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>just&#x2010;stylesheet&#x2010;replacement
					themes <i class="SO-CALLED">skins</i></strong>
					(<time datetime="2017-11-20">20 November
					2017</time>).

				At the same time as I was working on these big
					changes on the big GlitchSoc codebase (now
					deployed across multiple servers!), I was
					growing <strong class="MARK">increasingly
					disillusioned with big codebases</strong> and
					applications in general.
				I <strong class="MARK">didn't like the way that the
					Web App was trending</strong>&#x2014;towards
					<strong class="MARK">big, centralized apps
					which try to do everything,</strong> as
					opposed to <strong class="MARK">small,
					personalized, forkable ones</strong> that do
					One Task Only, which I think the Web App model
					is <strong class="MARK">inherently
					well&#x2010;suited for.</strong>
				I wanted web apps that <strong class="MARK">looked
					and functioned like DSi applications,</strong>
					that <strong class="MARK">came in multiple
					skins and colours,</strong> that <strong
					class="MARK">could be saved to disk and run
					without needing a server,</strong> and which
					were <strong class="MARK">written in
					human&#x2010;readable HTML and
					JavaScript</strong> such that <strong
					class="MARK">anyone could modify them and make
					them their own.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				To this end, and drawing inspiration from both the
					DSi and apps like OmmWriter, I created a
					<strong class="MARK">small plain&#x2010;text
					writing app,</strong> which I called <strong
					class="MARK"><a
					href="http://go.KIBI.family/Apps/Writer/"><i
					>KibiWriter</i></a></strong>.
				It was <strong class="MARK">essentially just a
					glorified <code>&lt;textarea<wbr />&gt;</code
					>,</strong> and I <strong class="MARK">threw
					it together in about a day</strong> just to
					show the sorts of <strong class="MARK"
					>low&#x2010;effort, compact Web App
					projects</strong> people could do if they ever
					bothered.
				(It was astonishing to me&#x2014;given the
					simplicity of throwing a <code
					>&lt;textarea<wbr />&gt;</code> on a page and
					styling it&#x2014;that small, themed
					plain&#x2010;text editors <strong class="MARK"
					>aren't something that hardly anyone on the
					Internet has made before.</strong>
				<strong class="MARK">Nobody builds web apps like
					this</strong>&#x2014;and I don't understand
					why?
				I mean&#x2014;it's <strong class="MARK"
					>personal,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>wholesome,</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>can't be used to turn a profit,</strong> so I
					guess I <em>understand</em> why… but <strong
					class="MARK">that's precisely the problem,
					though.</strong>)
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">Small, hand&#x2010;coded web
					apps,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>webrings,</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>indie web design and publishing</strong
					>&#x2014;these things were my focus as summer
					came to a close in 2017.
