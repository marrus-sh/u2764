				<p><em><b class="DROP">l</b>ast night i dreamt of college.</em> <u class="S">n</u>ot such a strange occurance, but what made this dream interesting was that it actually seemed... happy?! <u class="S">b</u>ecause college was not generally a very happy time for me. <u class="S">b</u>ut i think there is a part of me which misses having an apartment and living with friends.</p>
				<p><u class="S">i</u>t is a difficult thing for me to reason about, because in many ways i feel i am happier, healthier, and more stable as i am now. <u class="S">b</u>ut in other ways, it feels as though the feet have been taken out from under me.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p><b class="DROP">i</b> also spent a good deal of time—too much, really—thinking about english orthography—which is to say my respelling rules feel very firm by now, and i am just waiting on my codex software (<abbr title="work in progress">w.i.p.</abbr>) such that i have a place to document it. <u class="S">i</u> despise like 90% of the people who speak in runes, but i even had a look at the anglo­‑saxon fuþorc, and it turns out that an anglo­‑saxon alphabet is quite suited to english (who would have thought?), so the case may be that i am unwittingly inventing a runic transliteration system as well. <u class="S">t</u>he major question is diacritics!</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">th</b>ere are actually a great many projects which i am itching to write codices/encyclopædias/handbooks/primers/etc. for, which is why i have been working so hard on programming of late! <u class="S">w</u>riting tests has been exhausting. <u class="S">b</u>ut i’m excited with where it is heading.</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">th</b>is letter comes to you a little late—i spent last night working hard on refactoring my <u class="NAME">Resource</u> code to make use of <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-proxy-objects"><u class="NAME">ECMAScript Proxy Objects</u></a>—so that the triple <code>&lt;example:1&gt; rdfs:label &quot;Example&quot;.</code> can be written plainly as</p>
				<pre><code>const resource = new Resource ("example:1")
resource[pname`rdfs:label`] = "Example"</code></pre>
				<p>which needless to say was a lot of work for a primarily aesthetic improvement—and i still haven’t written the tests yet.</p>
				<p><u class="S">m</u>y initial hope for this project was to try to keep the whole library under 65,536 characters, but considering i am presently at 61,020, that is looking increasingly unlikely. <u class="S">b</u>ut surely 1,114,112 is still a reasonable upper bound! :P. <u class="S">t</u>he length comes from my insistence on doing everything in a single file—so that includes basic data structures, more advanced graph/resource operations, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/"><u class="NAME">N‑Triples</u></a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/"><u class="NAME">Turtle</u></a> <abbr title="Input/Output">i/o</abbr>, <u class="NAME"><abbr>HMTL</abbr></u> and native <u class="NAME">JavaScript</u> output, and of course the actual codex software itself.</p>

				<p><u class="S">h</u>ere’s the thing. <u class="S">w</u>hen it comes to knowing if your takes are worthwhile, you can’t learn that if you only listen to yourself. <u class="S">y</u>ou can’t learn that from your followers, either. <u class="S">y</u>ou gotta actually like... broaden your horizons a bit... and, like, read a book.</p>
				<p><u class="S">t</u>he word “read” here is flexible but the word “book” isn’t. <u class="S">i</u> mean, you can listen to an audiobook. <u class="S">b</u>ut the thing about a book is it’s actually, y’know, <em>edited</em>, and not the off­‑the­‑cuff sort of friendchat that fills social media and—yes—podcasts. <u class="S">f</u>riendchat is important—conversation is where synthesis happens—but friendchat cannot check you when you’re talking out your ass. <u class="S">y</u>ou gotta read a book.</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">f</b>olks who were around on mastodon in 2017 might remember what was described as the magic of that time. <u class="S">t</u>hink my <a href="https://www.u2764.com/NFIC/2018-02-05/CMON0100/"><u class="NAME">CYBREMONDAY</u></a> (2018) zine; there were folks trying to figure out how to hack the blockchiain to give trans girls money; there were folks joining up to make music, podcasts, games; <a href="https://mutant.tech/">Mutant Standard</a> got started around that time, as did <a href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/">GlitchSoc</a>, which i was involved in. <u class="S">f</u>or a long time i thought that magic was driven by a lie, which collapsed sometime mid­‑2018, but with the stuff going on about <a href="https://elekk.xyz/tags/MastoMonday"><u class="NAME">#MastoMonday</u></a> lately i’m beginning to wonder if maybe that magic is still alive. <u class="S">m</u>aybe what’s changed... is my relation to it.</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">i</b> actually did update <a href="https://go.KIBI.family/">my webpage</a>! <u class="S">i</u>t looks all clean and professional now. <u>i</u>t actually took me somewhat by surprise, seeing how many things i had listed on it, because in the past it has always seemed a struggle finding anything to list at all. <u class="S">i</u> guess i have been busy? <u class="S">a</u>nd that’s not even counting the fact that i, like, did a <u class="NAME">NaNoWriMo</u> last year.</p>
				<p><u class="S">i</u> still feel like most of my work over the past few years has been primarily not useful to anyone but myself. <u>i</u> think doing things which are helpful to other people might be my 2020 goal.</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">th</b>ere’s a phrase: <u class="S">t</u>he best camera for capturing a moment is the one you have with you? <u>i</u> feel like i don’t hear that phrase enough. <u class="S">t</u>he best publishing platform is the one you have access to. <u class="S">t</u>he best chat app is the one your friends have installed. <u class="S">t</u>he best digital audio workstation is the one which runs on your computer. <u class="S">i</u> think sometimes we get so caught up in obtaining the proper equipment that we forget to capture the moment using the equipment we have. <u class="S">d</u>on’t run home for your <abbr title="Digital Single­‑lens Reflex Camera">DSLR</abbr>, pull out your phone and take a picture of the damn sunset. <u class="S">y</u>’know?</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">i</b> was speaking with a friend earlier, and one topic which came up was how the things a person might seek out of a friendship might change over the course of recovery. <u class="S">i</u>n <b>stage I</b>, it is important to have people who listen to and validate your experiences. <u class="S">i</u>n <b>stage II</b>, you need people who will give you space and respect your emotional unavailability. <u class="S">b</u>ut come <b>stage III</b>, you need people who will invest themselves and their time in you, to assert for yourself that it is possible for you to have “normal”, healthy, intimate relationships again.</p>
				<p><u class="S">i</u> think the transition from <b>stage I</b> to <b>stage II</b> typically comes pretty easily (thankfully), since the people who listen to and affirm survivors are typically <em>other survivors</em>, who have similar needs themselves, or at least understand them. <u class="S">b</u>ut everyone makes the transition from <b>stage II</b> to <b>stage III</b> at different times. <u class="S">a</u>nd that is hard, because your existing friends stop being able to meet your needs, and because the people you need now are the same sort you have spent the last year(s) pushing away. <u class="S">i</u>t is especially hard on a place like mastodon, which is Not That Large Actually, where most of the social groups you might try to insert yourself into already know your face, even if you are like me, and regularly change your accounts.</p>
				<p><u class="S">e</u>ven among groups that commonly tout things like “people change”, i think we could use some more recognition that people’s <em>needs</em> change, too.</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">s</b>omething i have always appreciated about japanese is the incredibly mixed nature of its script—in one paragraph one might find kanji, hiragana, katakana, hindu­‑arabic numerals, latin letters, assorted symbols and punctuation, and—netled within an unassuming kaomoji, tibetan marks or canadian syllabics or any host of other characters. <u class="S">s</u>omething i have always appreciated about unicode is the fact that it makes this radical mixing of scripts possible.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p><b class="DROP">a</b>mong speakers of latin­‑script languages especially, i think there is a tendency to forget that unicode is largely jut a compilation of historical artefacts, a corpus of marks which humans have bothered to make on pages over the years. <u class="S">t</u>here is nothing innate or magical about an arbitrary assignment of codepoints to a selection of historically­‑meaningful glyphs, and that set can be expanded at any time. <u class="S">i</u> recently learned that <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-analysestring/?chars=%E1%9B%B1%E1%9B%B2%E1%9B%B3">three of the characters in the runic block</a> are tolkienian inventions, encoded solely because he happened to use them in the <cite>Hobbit</cite>. <u class="S">a</u>nd then of course there are <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-analysestring/?chars=%E2%84%B2%E2%85%8E%E2%86%83%E2%86%84%E2%B1%B5%E2%B1%B6">the claudian letters</a>, and any number of others. <u class="S">u</u>nicode is not a language society; their business is not to decree how these glyphs might be employed by a language; and indeed any person finds themself with the whole of the corpus at their disposal, to do with as they please.</p>
				<p><u class="S">i</u> want to see more people doing interesting things with them.</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">o</b>ne phrase which i have never placed much stock in is the phrase “bad at writing”. <u class="S">i</u> have seen people, with no hint of irony, send off texts or social media posts saying they “can’t write”, and it takes everything in me not to reply: <u class="S">y</u>ou do know that you’re writing right now, don’t you? <u class="S">b</u>ut what they mean is that they are not practiced in a certain <em>form</em> of writing, that they do not meet the prescriptive standards by which our society judges those who might seek the label of “writer”. <u class="S">a</u>nd, i think those are bollocks, so.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p><b class="DROP">i</b> think the same is true of programming, only worse, by which i mean the arbitrary standards are. <u class="S">t</u>his is the intent behind my <a href="https://elekk.xyz/tags/prrgrrmmng"><u class="NAME">#prrgrrmmng</u></a> hashtag, why i refuse the terms “coding” and “coder”, and why, despite my general affinity for their ethos, i will never identify as “hacker”. <u class="S">a</u>nd part of this comes from my <u class="NAME">macOS</u> roots; the <u class="NAME">AppleScript</u> mentality of programming scripts without need for a terminal, an understanding of the underlying technologies, or a real programming language. <u class="S">i</u>t is a far distance from that to C or Rust or whatever the “coding world” thinks “good programs” should be written in.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p><b class="DROP">o</b>f course, some people say they “can’t write/program” and mean instead that they don’t <em>want</em> to. <u class="S">b</u>ut that is a different conversation entirely.</p>

				<p><b class="DROP">t</b>oday’s contentious hot take is about <a href="https://elekk.xyz/tags/javascript"><u class="NAME">#javascript</u></a>, and it is this: <u class="S">j</u>avascript code (especially: libraries, packages) should emphasize flexibility over efficiency (or, for that matter, simplicity). <u class="S">t</u>his is not to say that efficiency/simplicity is not important, but: efficiency requires rigidity, and simplicity requires straightforwardness, and (to put it another way) if your goal is to emphasize those things, you <em>should not be writing javascript</em>. <u class="S">b</u>ecause as a prototype­‑based language, the whole <em>point</em> of javascript is that everything can be mucked with, and nothing is necessarily quite what it seems. <u class="S">t</u>hat is not simple <em>or</em> efficient. <u class="S">t</u>hat is not what javascript is <em>for</em>.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p><b class="DROP">th</b>is speaks to an underlying problem which i think plagues javascript development, which is that people tend to treat it like whatever class­‑based compiled language they are used to, only worse, instead of seeing it as its own language with its own strengths. <u class="S">w</u>hich means you never see people programming to take advantage of those strengths, only to mitigate its weaknesses. <u class="S">t</u>he javascript meta would look <em>very</em> different if writing flexible, prototype­‑informed (beyond simple inheritance) code was the norm, and by different i mean more diverse and interesting, and less universalizing or scalable. <u class="S">m</u>any of the assumptions in today’s code simply would not hold. <u class="S">j</u>avascript is not a language for people making assumptions.</p>
