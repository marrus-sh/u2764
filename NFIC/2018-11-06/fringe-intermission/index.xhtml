			This post is the fourth in a series of posts chronicling
				my personal history of involvement with the fringe
				development scene on Mastodon, detailing the
				origins of the movement, and touching on a number
				of larger cultural developments and trends taking
				place in the Mastodon communit<span class="OPTION"
				>{<span class="CASE">y</span>|<span class="CASE"
				>ies</span>}</span> more broadly.
			<strong class="MARK"><dfn>Fringe development</dfn> is my
				term for the development work (research; design;
				coding) taking place on forks and individual
				instances of Mastodon, <em>without</em> the
				intention of sending that work upstream, and
				without mainstream acknowledgment or
				recognition.</strong>
			Increasingly, as Mastodon as a project grows, I believe
				that it is this development work that happens <i
				class="SO-CALLED">on the fringes</i> that will
				shape the future of the software.

			<h2>An Intermission</h2>
			<p>
				When I first started planning out this Mastodon
					history series, I had planned for it to be
					<strong class="MARK">a <em>lot</em>
					shorter.</strong>
				The entire <a href="
https://www.u2764.com/NFIC/2018-09-09/fringe-beginnings/">first post</a
					>&#x2014;where I go into the <strong
					class="MARK">racist drama</strong> that struck
					Mastodon in <time datetime="2017-02">February
					2017</time>&#x2014;was <strong class="MARK"
					>off the menu;</strong> the plan was to start
					in <time datetime="2017-04">April</time>,
					where <cite>Mourning Mastodon</cite> had left
					off, and with my joining of the GlitchSoc
					fork.
				As I got <strong class="MARK">further and
					further</strong> into the writing process,
					however, I realized that there was <strong
					class="MARK">no way that this would
					work:</strong>
				The events which had taken place that February had
					<strong class="MARK">so deeply underpinned
					everything which came after</strong> that
					<strong class="MARK">I couldn't <em>not</em>
					bring them up</strong>&#x2014;and, well:
				They had <strong class="MARK">never been recorded
					before.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, <strong class="MARK">I found myself
					hesitating,</strong> and as I pieced my
					thoughts together, I realized that I was
					<strong class="MARK">hesitating because I was
					afraid.</strong>
				I was afraid because <strong class="MARK">this was
					something nobody talked about</strong
					>&#x2014;this was something I had
					<strong class="MARK">nobody <em>to</em> talk
					about <em>with</em></strong>&#x2014;and no
					real evidence to support, beyond potential
					corroboration from others who were also
					present at the time.
				I was afraid that somebody would tell me that what
					I had <strong class="MARK">seen and heard with
					my own eyes and ears</strong> was wrong, that
					<strong class="MARK">the racism and
					harassment</strong> that I knew was <strong
					class="MARK">this platform's heritage</strong>
					was a myth, that I was <strong class="MARK"
					>just stirring up drama</strong> and it
					<strong class="MARK">didn't matter
					anyway.</strong>
				I published in spite of these fears
					because&#x2014;well, <strong class="MARK"
					>that's what responsible journalism is
					about,</strong> isn't it?
				Saying <strong class="MARK">what needs to be
					said.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				As I have been working on and reworking this post,
					I have found myself <strong class="MARK"
					>confronting all of those same fears.</strong>
				As a matter of fact, <strong class="MARK">this time
					it's worse,</strong> because I'm not just
					talking about <strong class="MARK">some
					singular event in the distant past which noöne
					remembers</strong>&#x2014;I'm talking about
					<strong class="MARK">systemic issues in the
					here&#x2010;and&#x2010;now.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">I don't think <i
					>gaslighting</i> is the correct word</strong>
					for this situation&#x2014;it's a word that I
					see thrown around sometimes, for that feeling
					<strong class="MARK">when you see something
					wrong but nobody else is saying anything and
					noöne seems to want to talk about it and you
					start to wonder if you've <em>lost your
					mind.</em></strong>
				But gaslighting is a <strong class="MARK">targeted
					abuse tactic</strong> aimed at maximizing
					control; gaslighting is when you approach your
					significant other hoping to talk about
					how&#x2014;you think, maybe&#x2014;they have
					treated you like shit for the past several
					months, and instead of having a conversation
					about it, they respond with <i>no I haven't;
					none of that is real; if it were it would be
					your own fault&#x2014;and how dare you lash
					out at me that way?</i>
				…<em>This</em> is more just a <strong class="MARK"
					>culture of denial,</strong> of <strong
					class="MARK">respectability,</strong> and,
					well&#x2014;
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">My excuse</strong> for writing
					this post, and this history&#x2014;because
					realtalk, this post is a good 75% of what this
					history series has been about&#x2014;is that I
					have a <strong class="MARK">number of
					supporters,</strong> some of whom have been
					<strong class="MARK">contributing
					financially</strong> to keep me afloat, some
					of whom have been doing so <strong
					class="MARK">because of the very work that I
					have been describing</strong> in these
					posts&#x2014;and I owe it to those people to
					be <strong class="MARK">frank and honest about
					what has been going on</strong> for the past
					year and the <strong class="MARK">truth behind
					my involvement</strong> in these things.
				I do want you to <strong class="MARK">pause and
					think about that word&#x2014;<i>excuse</i
					></strong>&#x2014;how <strong class="MARK">I
					feel like I need an <em>excuse</em></strong>
					to talk about my feelings and my experiences,
					because without one they are <strong
					class="MARK">too quickly invalidated,</strong>
					too easily dismissed.
				How I have to <strong class="MARK">put my entire
					post on hold</strong> and take the time to
					focus your attention on that fact.
				How I'm <strong class="MARK">burying the
					lede:</strong> currently, right now, in this
					post, paragraphs and paragraphs of explanation
					and justification and rationalization without
					yet ever getting to my point; currently, right
					now, in this entire series, because we're
					<strong class="MARK">four posts in and I'm
					only just starting to get to the important
					part.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				These are things which, frankly, <strong
					class="MARK">I don't expect all of you to
					catch the significance of.</strong>
				This is Mastodon, where culture A is techbros who
					<strong class="MARK">talk about <i
					class="SO-CALLED">security</i> like it's a
					variable to optimize for</strong> and culture
					B is white trans girls who <strong
					class="MARK">pass around objectifying pictures
					of women like they're candy.</strong>
				I'm writing this post for <strong class="MARK">the
					handful of you who might;</strong> who might
					close your eyes and whisper:
				<strong class="MARK"><q>She finally said it.</q
					></strong>
				I'm writing this post for <strong class="MARK">the
					historians,</strong> also, and <strong
					class="MARK">the academics,</strong> because
					Mastodon really is quite unique and
					groudbreaking in a lot of ways, and <strong
					class="MARK">these aren't the sorts of
					circumstances that come about more than once
					in a planet's lifetime.</strong>
				And, of course, <strong class="MARK">I'm writing
					this post for myself,</strong> maybe most of
					all, because after the past year I
					<em>really</em> need some closure, I need to
					be able to put this all behind me and tell
					myself:
				<strong class="MARK"><q>It's okay to move on.</q
					></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">I've been grappling</strong>
					with how to talk about the content of this
					post ever since I first decided I wanted to
					do this history series, <strong class="MARK"
					>how much detail</strong> I should go into
					and <strong class="MARK">what I should
					include,</strong> and, like with my first post
					about the events of February, this one
					originally <strong class="MARK">wasn't even
					on the menu.</strong>
				Up until now&#x2014;I don't know if you've
					noticed&#x2014;I've limited myself to mostly
					analysing things with an <strong class="MARK"
					>academic, historical sort of voice,</strong>
					never going deeper than <strong class="MARK"
					>stating the events which occurred</strong>
					and <strong class="MARK">in what order</strong
					> and <strong class="MARK">looking into the
					reasons why.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				But what I've realized is that <strong class="MARK"
					>there's no way I can maintain that</strong>
					for the entire rest of this series and still
					<strong class="MARK">say everything which
					deserves to be said.</strong>
				I need to pause, take a moment, and really <strong
					class="MARK">spell out the emotional
					impact</strong> of this all without trying
					to hide it <strong class="MARK">behind
					relationships of cause and effect.</strong>
				So that's what this post is&#x2014;<strong
					class="MARK">an intermission,</strong> a
					pause in the history, for really just <strong
					class="MARK">laying bare some shit on
					Mastodon</strong> and the experience of
					Mastodon development, for talking about
					<strong class="MARK">how it has affected me
					and the people close to me,</strong> and for
					<strong class="MARK">setting the record
					straight</strong> such that when I say,
					<strong class="MARK"><q>I didn't have the
					energy to remain involved in Mastodon dev,</q
					></strong> you all will know <em>exactly</em>
					where that sentence is coming from.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">This series isn't over</strong
					>&#x2014;I still need to talk more about my
					work on Mastodon themeïng, about Mastodon GO!
					and my attempts at a refactor, about <cite
					>CYBREMONDAY</cite>, my work on
					specifications like <cite>MonStrPub</cite>, my
					refocusing on internet publishing and the
					tools thereof, <cite>ActivityPress</cite>, and
					where I'm planning on going from here.
				We're… <strong class="MARK">maybe halfway</strong>
					through everything that I have to say.
				And, I suppose, if you're especially callous, you
					can probably <strong class="MARK">skip this
					post entirely</strong> and not miss out on a
					whole lot as far as that all is concerned.
			</p>
			<p>
				But I'm <strong class="MARK">hoping you
					won't:</strong>
				I'm hoping you read this post, and it resonates
					with some part of you, and you understand;
					honestly, I'm hoping it's <strong class="MARK"
					>at least a little bit educational,</strong>
					if not <em>as</em> educational as the rest of
					this  series, because hey, maybe that means
					we'll be on a path towards things getting
					better.
				I'm hoping I <strong class="MARK">get at least one
					response</strong> that says, you know, <q
					>that's fucked up and i'm sorry and yr
					feelings r valid.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">Don't say it if you don't
					mean it,</strong> though.
				I'm not gonna begrudge you for <strong class="MARK"
					>needing time to think</strong> on this one.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="exploitation">
			<h2>A Culture of Exploitation</h2>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">There is another
					reason</strong> why I have hesitated on
					writing this post&#x2014;aside from a stifling
					culture of denial and doubting my own sanity,
					I mean&#x2014;and that's because I was really
					<strong class="MARK">rather hoping that
					somebody else would say it first.</strong>
				It's the sort of thing that really works better
					when <strong class="MARK">someone else brings
					it up:</strong>
				<q>Hey, so&#x2010;and&#x2010;so has really been
					doing a lot for y'all and they deserve to be
					treated better</q> is a sentence which, under
					white respectability culture, sounds a lot
					more heartfelt and genuine <strong
					class="MARK">when <i
					>so&#x2010;and&#x2010;so</i> isn't
					yourself.</strong>
				I was hoping that someone who <em>wasn't</em> a
					developer or caretaker or public figure,
					someone who <em>wasn't</em> me or one of my
					friends who have been struggling with this,
					would <strong class="MARK">maybe take a hint
					that things weren't totally that great</strong
					> and rally the forces to possibly try to do
					something about it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, the truth is that <strong class="MARK"
					>the people who aren't struggling with this
					are more&#x2010;often&#x2010;than&#x2010;not
					the ones perpetuating it,</strong> and even
					when they're not, they don't care, or at
					least&#x2014;most generously, because <strong
					class="MARK">there <em>are</em> some of you
					that I do love and trust and believe in out
					there</strong>&#x2014;at least haven't had
					the life experiences to notice this sort of
					shit and <strong class="MARK">realize what is
					going on.</strong>
				And yes, I'm a gender studies major, I took an
					<strong class="MARK">entire semester on how
					caretaking work is devalued and exploited by
					sociëty,</strong> it's probably unfair for me
					to expect others to be clued into those sorts
					of things when they've <strong class="MARK"
					>spent their entire lives studying
					circuitboards or machine code or
					whatever</strong> and are told by their
					employers to <strong class="MARK">view people
					as just <i class="SO-CALLED">that thing which
					generates requests for our REST API</i
					>.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				But the fact of the matter is:
				<strong class="MARK">Mastodon has a culture of
					exploitation,</strong> and it's really bad.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've already discussed&#x2014;in <cite>Mourning
					Mastodon</cite>, and elsewhere&#x2014;how
					<strong class="MARK">Mastodon <em
					>development</em> has largely operated
					through a mechanism of exploitation,</strong>
					where queer and marginalized users <strong
					class="MARK">raise warnings and design
					features</strong> which upstream then adopts,
					often with <strong class="MARK">little
					acknowledgment, recognition, or
					compensation,</strong> and often <strong
					class="MARK">well after their moment of need
					has begun.</strong>
				But Mastodon's culture of exploitation is <strong
					class="MARK">not limited to its development
					staff</strong>&#x2014;as a matter of fact,
					<strong class="MARK">Mastodon exploits its
					developers too,</strong> especially <strong
					class="MARK">those on the fringes,</strong>
					who are often volunteers, as well as <strong
					class="MARK">its instance admins and
					moderators,</strong> who are certainly never
					compensated their worth for protecting users
					from <strong class="MARK"> The Entirety Of
					The Fediverse.</strong>
				Mastodon <strong class="MARK"><em>is a culture</em
					> built upon entitlement</strong
					>&#x2014;<strong class="MARK">entitled</strong
					> to this space, <strong class="MARK"
					>entitled</strong> to set the limits of
					discourse, <strong class="MARK"
					>entitled</strong> to read what you have to
					say, <strong class="MARK">entitled</strong>
					to react, <strong class="MARK"
					>entitled</strong> to respond, <strong
					class="MARK">entitled</strong> to be heard,
					<strong class="MARK">entitled</strong> to new
					features, <strong class="MARK"
					>entitled</strong> to others' time, <strong
					class="MARK">entitled</strong> to others'
					care&#x2014;and it <strong class="MARK"><em
					>is a culture</em> built upon
					exploitation,</strong> where <strong
					class="MARK">the vast majority of users coast
					along</strong> on the efforts of a few <span
					class="OPTION">{<span class="CASE"
					>developers</span> | <span class="CASE"
					>admins</span> | <span class="CASE"
					>moderators</span> | <span class="CASE"
					>caretakers</span>}</span> without ever
					offering <strong class="MARK">more than the
					basest acknowledgment</strong> or <strong
					class="MARK">anything resembling fair
					compensation,</strong> and certainly not
					<strong class="MARK">taking steps to
					ensure that the people in these roles are
					able to sustainably maintain them into the
					future.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				And <strong class="MARK">what happens</strong>
					when they burn out?
				When drama hits, or they get sick, or are hit with
					a new employment situation, or need to take
					care of a loved one, or any one of the <strong
					class="MARK">innumerable things</strong> which
					can make somebody <strong class="MARK">no
					longer capable</strong> of handling the large
					amounts of remote caretaking work that
					Mastodon demands?
				Well, if the person in question is trans, then
					<strong class="MARK"><a href="
https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/10/call-out-culture-fails-trans-women/
">social death is real death</a>,</strong> as they say.
			</p>
			<p>
				And I say this while acknowledging that <strong
					class="MARK">there are people with real,
					critical, urgent needs</strong> on the
					fediverse, and without suggesting that those
					needs are not valid or should not be met.
				<strong class="MARK">Of course they are, and
					should.</strong>
				But what I see time and time again is that <strong
					class="MARK"><em>it is the same people</em>
					doing the work</strong> to meet those
					needs&#x2014;until they burn out; until they
					no longer can&#x2014;and that the rest of the
					Mastodon community is <strong class="MARK"
					>more&#x2010;or&#x2010;less content</strong>
					to let them carry that burden, with little in
					the way of support, and then <strong
					class="MARK">cast them to the side</strong>
					once their usefulness has worn thin.
				And, of course, the truly needy among us are only
					tolerated so long as they <strong
					class="MARK">shitpost in the
					culturally&#x2010;appropriate manner,</strong>
					or make takes and
					calls&#x2010;to&#x2010;action that <strong
					class="MARK">leave white people feeling good
					when they click <i class="SO-CALLED">boost</i
					>,</strong> and <strong class="MARK">carefully
					cultivate their #brand</strong> (because
					that's what it is) to appropriately match
					Mastodon's expectations for <strong
					class="MARK">what a marginalized person
					should say and do.</strong>
				People who are able to do these things well <strong
					class="MARK">can tap into Mastodon time and
					time again,</strong> extracting whatever
					value they want; people who fail at them have
					<strong class="MARK">difficulty getting
					connected with resources that they sorely
					need</strong>&#x2014;and, in all likelihood,
					silently disappear.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's <strong class="MARK">not hard to come up with
					an explanation</strong> for these behaviours:
				Mastodon remains largely a culture of techies, and
					<strong class="MARK">tech is an entire <em
					>industry</em> founded upon exploiting the
					labour of others</strong>&#x2014;be it <strong
					class="MARK">users,</strong> <strong
					class="MARK">cafeteria and restaurant
					workers,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>custodial staff,</strong> <strong
					class="MARK">factory workers,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">drivers,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">housekeepers,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">nannies,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">parents,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">spouses,</strong> or
					<strong class="MARK">friends</strong
					>&#x2014;and it <strong class="MARK"><a href="
https://medium.com/matter/the-women-i-pretend-to-be-ef0a5ce97277
">isn't as though being a woman exempts you</a> from the
					consequences</strong> of living and breathing
					in a <strong class="MARK">toxic, white,
					masculinist culture</strong> every day, and
					certainly not for those among us for whom
					<strong class="MARK">that culture is
					more&#x2010;or&#x2010;less all we have ever
					known.</strong>
				Not to cast too thin a line, but
					by&#x2010;and&#x2010;large tech culture
					<strong class="MARK">does not know how to
					take care of itself,</strong> <strong
					class="MARK">does not know how to take care
					of others,</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>does not know how to recognize care</strong>
					when it sees it taking place.

			<h2>Two Quick Rebuttals</h2>
			<p>
				I anticipate <strong class="MARK">two major
					responses</strong> to the above claims.
				The first is, as already mentioned, <strong
					class="MARK">denial</strong>, arguïng that
					the problem is imagined, or overstated, or
					localized to just one small corner of the
					fediverse, or just one small group of people.
				To this I ask:
				<strong class="MARK">Where, then, are Mastodon's
					caretakers?</strong>
				Where are the people <strong class="MARK">greeting
					new users</strong> as they sign on, <strong
					class="MARK">communicating with
					people</strong> about their needs, <strong
					class="MARK">checking in with random
					strangers</strong> to make sure they feel
					accepted and their day is going okay,
					<strong class="MARK">working to
					advocate for them</strong> on a development
					level and build the features they need,
					<strong class="MARK">creating Issues and
					spreading them around</strong> for important
					concerns, <strong class="MARK">working to
					bridge the cultural gaps</strong> between
					communities and resolve disputes, and
					<strong class="MARK">literally being people's
					literal mother</strong> in times of crisis
					when they have nobody else to turn to?
				<strong class="MARK">I have done these
					things.</strong>
				<strong class="MARK">I know so many people</strong>
					who have done these things.
				<strong class="MARK">None of us are doing them any
					longer.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				(If there <em>is</em> a secret Mastodon sociëty of
					caretakers out there, tell me where I can sign
					up to get some service, because I feel about
					<strong class="MARK">5000 spoons in the
					hole</strong> right now.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The second, more insidious response that I expect
					is <strong class="MARK">resignation:</strong>
				Nevermind that <strong class="MARK">Mastodon once
					<em>had</em> all of these things;</strong>
					toxic individualism is <strong class="MARK"
					>the end product of all social media,</strong>
					we're all just here to piggyback each other's
					labour for a <strong class="MARK">personal,
					social high,</strong> for favs and boosts and
					a place to vent without regard for our
					surroundings, and it was <strong class="MARK"
					>misguided from the start</strong> to expect
					anything better.
				And, historically speaking?
				<strong class="MARK">Yes, it was.</strong>
				All of the people who set their minds to turning
					Mastodon into a warm, nurturing space are now
					<strong class="MARK">hurt,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">traumatized,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">burned out,</strong> have
					<strong class="MARK">difficulty even <em
					>using</em> the default web app</strong>
					because the visual layout or colour scheme or
					branding or <i class="SO-CALLED">boop</i>
					sound all remind us of months of hard,
					difficult work and exploitation that <strong
					class="MARK">never amounted to
					anything</strong> in the long run.
				But I think it is <strong class="MARK">wrong to see
					this chain of events as inevitable,</strong>
					as though it wasn't the <strong
					class="MARK">direct result of a pattern of
					use and neglect</strong> on the part of the
					people here, as though, if everyone was on
					the same page about this and put in the
					necessary forethought and planning, we
					couldn't have created a network that <strong
					class="MARK">valued and protected its
					caretakers</strong> and had systems in place
					to <strong class="MARK">help people transition
					in <em>and out</em> of those roles.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				And maybe that <em>is</em> too much to ask, in
					these times, when everyone has so many other
					concerns plaguing them, when we're so busy
					worrying about <strong class="MARK">the
					survivability of ourselves and our own
					bodies,</strong> to think about and plan for
					the survivability of an online social network
					where we spend some of our time.
				Or maybe that's a discussion which <strong
					class="MARK">still needs to happen.</strong>
				What I do know is that the <strong class="MARK"
					>hurt and trauma already present on this
					network</strong> isn't going anywhere anytime
					soon, and it's about time <strong class="MARK"
					>Mastodon started accounting for that
					fact.</strong>

			<h2>A Typical Timeline for Caretaking Work on
				Mastodon</h2>
			<p>
				It's <strong class="MARK">easy for me to speak
					about</strong> Mastodon's culture of
					exploitation because, well, <strong
					class="MARK">I've lived it,</strong> multiple
					times over, and seen my friends go through it
					<strong class="MARK">time and time
					again.</strong>
				The pattern is <strong class="MARK">depressingly
					regular,</strong> occuring over <strong
					class="MARK">five stages:</strong>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Present a
							problem.</strong></strong>
						In the early days of Mastodon, the major
							problem was <strong class="MARK"
							>onboarding</strong> and <strong
							class="MARK">community
							management.</strong>
						Then it was <strong class="MARK"
							>developing new features.</strong>
						Then it was <strong class="MARK"
							>managing the fork,</strong>
							GlitchSoc.
						And there has always been the tasks of
							<strong class="MARK">listening to
							those in need,</strong> <strong
							class="MARK">negotiating
							disputes,</strong> <strong
							class="MARK">recording
							histories,</strong> <strong
							class="MARK">helping those without
							access to resources</strong>
							navigate their
							day&#x2010;to&#x2010;day issues,
							and <strong class="MARK">Keeping
							Trans Folks Alive.</strong>
						On Mastodon, there are <strong
							class="MARK">problems around
							every corner,</strong> for those
							who know how to look.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Extract
							labour.</strong></strong>
						Mastodon has had the good fortune of
							having a <strong class="MARK">steady
							stream of volunteer labour</strong>
							to rely on when addressing its most
							urgent concerns.
						Before the onboarding modal was
							implemented, there was <strong
							class="MARK">an onboarding
							team</strong> which would
							personally reach out to and welcome
							each new user to the fediverse,
							facilitated through a bot scanning
							the public timeline for toots from
							people it had never seen before.
						Mastodon's <strong class="MARK">content
							warnings,</strong> many different
							<strong class="MARK">kinds of
							mutes,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
							>theming system,</strong> and
							<strong class="MARK">profile
							metadata fields</strong> are all
							features designed and/or
							implemented in a large part through
							volunteer community labour.
						<strong class="MARK">Instance
							administration and
							moderation</strong> remains largely
							a volunteer occupation, as does the
							less&#x2010;visible work of
							<strong class="MARK">checking in
							with users and extending
							care.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						There is <strong class="MARK">nothing
							wrong with volunteering for a
							cause</strong> that you believe in,
							but systemically, this means that
							<strong class="MARK">the bulk of
							the caretaking work falls</strong>
							on <strong class="MARK">those who
							either can't afford</strong> to let
							it slip&#x2014;the most
							marginalized&#x2014;or <strong
							class="MARK">those who aren't
							willing to</strong
							>&#x2014;frequently because they
							are survivors of great moments of
							need themselves.
						Meanwhile, cis, white, privileged users,
							and the project as a whole, reap
							the benefit.
						<strong class="MARK">Mastodon would not
							still be around today</strong>
							without the many volunteer
							caretakers, admins, moderators, and
							developers who have donated their
							time to this project.
						But even though everyone else profits
							from their work, as a whole, they
							largely do not.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Generate
							burnout.</strong></strong>
						Mastodon <strong class="MARK">needs its
							caretakers,</strong> but it <strong
							class="MARK">does not protect
							them,</strong> and it <strong
							class="MARK">does nothing to ensure that they are given a manageäble load.</strong>
						To the contrary, Mastodon's
							care&#x2010;work is <strong
							class="MARK">perpetually
							understaffed</strong>&#x2014;and
							this is only becoming more of a
							problem as increasingly many people
							are driven away.
						Frequently, one kind of care work
							becomes <strong class="MARK">a
							gateway to more:</strong> an
							instance admin becomes a community
							moderator, or a developer of
							features for their instance; a
							manager for a fork becomes an
							admin to test the software they
							have written.
						Mastodon <strong class="MARK">encourages
							these consolidations of
							labour.</strong>
						It lacks the <strong class="MARK"
							>tools,</strong> <strong
							class="MARK">structures,</strong>
							and <strong class="MARK">motivated
							individuals</strong> necessary for
							dividing it up equally.
					</p>
					<p>
						Eventually, it all becomes too much, and
							caretaker in question finds
							themselves <strong class="MARK"
							>stepping out of the
							spotlight,</strong> <strong
							class="MARK">reducing their public
							presence,</strong> and <strong
							class="MARK">cutting back or
							terminating their
							involvment</strong> with the
							project.
						They <strong class="MARK">might feel
							unseen or unheard,</strong> they
							<strong class="MARK">might feel
							shame,</strong> and they <strong
							class="MARK">might feel
							used.</strong>
						With their reduced public presence,
							Mastodon as&#x2010;a&#x2010;whole
							largely <strong class="MARK">forgets
							that they ever existed.</strong>
						However, <strong class="MARK">their
							journey is not yet over.</strong>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Create
							drama.</strong></strong>
						Inevitably, <strong class="MARK"
							>drama happens.</strong>
						Relationship drama is, in my experience,
							probably the most effective for
							this, but instance or meta drama
							works just as well.
						At this point, the presence of the
							<strong class="MARK">old,
							burned&#x2010;out caretaker</strong>
							that the fediverse pushed too hard
							and never gave anything back to in
							return is <strong class="MARK">a
							collective embarrassment,</strong>
							a reminder of this platform's long
							history of taking advantage of
							others.
						So, needless to say, <strong class="MARK"
							>the source and credibility of the
							drama hardly matters.</strong>
						What is important is that it creates
							<strong class="MARK">an excuse to
							overlook one's past
							contributions</strong> by casting
							them in a new or different light.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Discard and
							repeat.</strong></strong>
						By <i class="SO-CALLED">discard</i>, I do
							not mean to suggest a loss of
							followers or, necessarily,
							visibility.
						What I do mean is a <strong
							class="MARK">loss of status,</strong
							> <strong class="MARK"
							>recognition,</strong> and, to an
							extent, <strong class="MARK"
							>personhood,</strong> such that one
							<strong class="MARK">no longer needs
							to be respected</strong> for their
							history of service, and can be
							<strong class="MARK">safely ignored
							when they attempt to speak
							out</strong> about their
							experiences.
						In some cases, followers and visibility
							are actually <em>increased</em>, as
							one's <strong class="MARK"
							>boundaries are invaded</strong> and
							everything one says and does is
							trivialized and reduced into a meme.
						Thus, <strong class="MARK">further
							exploitation can ensue.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Mastodon ex&#x2010;caretakers complain
							about <strong class="MARK">not
							feeling comfortable posting their
							opinions</strong> on their own
							timelines, about <strong
							class="MARK">randos jumping into
							their mentions</strong> over the
							slightest things, about <strong
							class="MARK">people questioning them
							out&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;<!--
							-->blue</strong> about work they
							did months or years ago, about
							being <strong class="MARK"
							>dropped,</strong> <strong
							class="MARK">ghosted,</strong> or
							<strong class="MARK"
							>abandoned</strong> by people they
							considered friends.
						Many <strong class="MARK">lock their
							accounts,</strong> are <strong
							class="MARK">hesitant to ever
							post</strong> publicly, and/or
							<strong class="MARK">greatly reduce
							their posting habits.</strong>
						Those that have accounts on Twitter often
							say that <strong class="MARK">they
							find the environment
							less&#x2010;stressful there.</strong
							>
					</p>
					<p>
						Meanwhile, the Mastodon exploitation
							machine moves on.
						Of course, <strong class="MARK"
							>caretakers are a limited
							resource,</strong> and eventually
							Mastodon will find itself out of
							people willing to commit themselves
							to this labour.
						At that point, <strong class="MARK">the
							software and community will fall
							apart.</strong>
						Personally, I see signs that this might
							<strong class="MARK">already be
							beginning to happen</strong> now.

			<h2>Macro and Micro</h2>
			<p>
				Thus far, <strong class="MARK">all of the examples
					I have given</strong> regarding the
					exploitation taking place on Mastodon have
					been <strong class="MARK">large, systemic,
					macro issues</strong>&#x2014;but the <strong
					class="MARK">same patterns</strong> take
					place on a <strong class="MARK">micro,
					interpersonal level</strong> as well.
				<strong class="MARK">I actually think this is far
					worse</strong> than the larger&#x2010;scale
					offenses, because when someone gets used by
					Mastodon as a system, <em>even if</em> nobody
					cares and <em>even if</em> there is currently
					zero interest in redressing those problems <em
					>right now</em>, it is <strong class="MARK">at
					least undeniable that they <em>happened</em
					>.</strong>
				<strong class="MARK">We <em>all</em> know
					somebody</strong>&#x2014;if you've been
					around on Mastodon at all in the past year,
					you probably know several&#x2014;<strong
					class="MARK">who <i class="SO-CALLED">used
					to</i></strong> be a community leader or
					contributor or organizer and has since been
					<strong class="MARK">driven to silence or
					irrelevance</strong> by the forces described
					above.
				If there were <strong class="MARK">any sort of
					community desire,</strong> it would not be
					difficult to check in with each and every one
					of these people to <strong class="MARK"
					>ensure that their needs are beïng cared
					for,</strong> and that they have <strong
					class="MARK">received what they believe to be
					suitable compensation</strong> for their work.
			</p>
			<p>
				But lately, however, I have begun to question
					whether this macro level of exploitation is
					<strong class="MARK">anything more than the
					tip of the iceberg</strong> when it comes to
					these sorts of offences.
				If there isn't a <strong class="MARK">deeper, more
					insidious culture</strong> of people taking
					advantage of each other which isn't being
					talked about on this site.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I was first getting involved with GlitchSoc
					last year, I had a <strong class="MARK"
					>somewhat naïve motto</strong> which I
					sort&#x2010;of lived by, which basically
					boiled down to <strong class="MARK"><i
					class="SO-CALLED">take care of the
					caretakers</i>.</strong>
				What this meant in practice was looking for those
					people who were <strong class="MARK"
					>consistently providing the emotional
					support</strong> necessary to maintain our
					communities&#x2014;and there were more of
					these people in those days, too; it's rather
					dropped off, wonder why&#x2014;looking for
					<strong class="MARK">those caretakers who
					didn't have caretakers of their own,</strong>
					and then <strong class="MARK">trying to be
					there for them</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">build a positive working
					relationship</strong> so that they
					could continue doïng their very important
					work.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason <em>why</em> <strong class="MARK">this
					approach was naïve</strong>&#x2014;which
					isn't to say it was misguided, although your
					milage may vary on that one&#x2014;was
					because, as I later discovered, <strong
					class="MARK">some people actually think that
					this terrible exploitative system,</strong> a
					system founded on constantly <strong
					class="MARK">taking from others</strong>
					rather than <strong class="MARK">giving from
					yourself,</strong> was <strong class="MARK"
					><em>actually what a healthy relationship was
					supposed to look like</em>,</strong> that a
					healthy relationship was just <strong
					class="MARK">two people doing that to <em
					>each other</em>.</strong>
				Or not even:
				That there were those who, exploited caretakers
					themselves, <strong class="MARK">suffered no
					qualms</strong> turning right around and
					exploiting others <strong class="MARK">in the
					exact same manner,</strong> giving nothing in
					return.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have already expressed, in my <a href="
https://www.u2764.com/NFIC/2018-08-11/girlfriends/">response to that
					piece on <i class="SO-CALLED">straight
					girlfriends</i></a>, that <strong class="MARK"
					>I am concerned about the dating culture
					taking place on Mastodon.</strong>
				As a traumatized, queer community, there is a
					<strong class="MARK">real shortage of
					positive examples of healthy
					relationships</strong> in both the media we
					consume and in our daily life.
				This is, actually, one of the reasons why I am a
					romance author.
				When Mastodon <strong class="MARK">fails to
					recognize and call out unfair use of
					labour</strong> on the large scale, when
					it is easy to identify, when there are users
					and pull requests and public toots and an
					undeniable record, it is <strong class="MARK"
					>hard for me to believe that it is managing
					any better</strong> at handling the less
					obvious, more private, intimate scale.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong class="MARK">It has been joked
					before,</strong> on numerous occasions, that
					Mastodon is <strong class="MARK">actually a
					queer dating site.</strong>
				<strong class="MARK">It should go without
					saying</strong> that <strong class="MARK"
					>this is only a strength</strong> of the
					platform <strong class="MARK">if the
					relationships which result are healthy
					ones,</strong> built on <strong class="MARK"
					>mutual love</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>respect</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>care,</strong> <strong class="MARK">good
					communication,</strong> <strong  class="MARK"
					>consent,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>accountability,</strong> and <strong
					class="MARK">understanding.</strong>
				<strong class="MARK">It should go without
					saying</strong> that <strong class="MARK">we
					have a duty to our queer users,</strong> many
					of whom are young, many of whom are
					inexperienced in romantic affairs, to <strong
					class="MARK">provide good mentorship,</strong>
					to <strong class="MARK">educate on warning
					signs and unhealthy behaviours,</strong> and
					to <strong class="MARK"><em>not</em>
					normalize toxic situations</strong> when they
					occur.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think <strong class="MARK">we have failed at
					this,</strong> as a community, <strong
					class="MARK">undeniably and
					overwhelmingly.</strong>
				There are days when Mastodon looks frighteningly
					like a network <strong class="MARK">groomed
					as a safe haven by abusers</strong> where
					they can <strong class="MARK">escape
					accountability for their deeds.</strong>
				(Need I say more on this one?
				I feel like this is <strong class="MARK">an open
					secret.</strong>)
				And I am <strong class="MARK">fearful for the
					consequences</strong> which that failure might
					bring.

		<section id="relationship">
			<h2>An Unhealthy Relationship</h2>
			<p>
				Again, <strong class="MARK">it's not hard</strong>
					for me to describe what this sort of
					exploitation looks like on an intimate level,
					because <strong class="MARK">it was my
					life</strong> for the first half of 2018.
				On <strong class="MARK"><time
					datetime="2018-01-15">15 January</time
					>,</strong> I entered into a relationship
					with someone who was, at the time, jobless,
					homeless, recovering from surgery,
					more&#x2010;or&#x2010;less wandering the
					earth and burning through what remaining
					resources they had.
				When we broke up a little over six months later,
					they had, by virtue of their own labour, but
					also the labour of myself and countless
					others, an apartment, with a stable tech
					salary, in their first&#x2010;choice city of
					residence, making probably more money in a
					single month than I have ever possessed in my
					entire life.
				Over that same period of time, I went from the
					<strong class="MARK">principal contributor and
					project manager</strong> for the GlitchSoc
					fork to a <strong class="MARK">relative
					nobody,</strong> <strong class="MARK">unable
					to maintain</strong> my contributions to
					Mastodon development, <strong class="MARK"
					>unable to sustain</strong> my various social
					connections on the site, and largely <strong
					class="MARK">unable to follow through</strong
					> on my various side&#x2010;projects such as
					the <cite>CYBREMONDAY</cite> zine.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the <strong class="MARK">KIBI Litmus Test
					For Unhealthy Relationships</strong> (<abbr
					>KiLTFUR</abbr>):
				When two people are in a close, intimate
					relationship, and one of them <strong
					class="MARK">sees their opportunities and
					material access to resources expanding
					dramatically</strong> while <strong
					class="MARK">the other one suffers,</strong>
					that's a sign that maybe things <strong
					class="MARK">aren't quite wonderful.</strong>
				That's a sign that maybe someone in the
					relationship <strong class="MARK">isn't
					contributing their fair share.</strong>
				It's not a perfect test by any means, but it does
					have the advantage of being <strong
					class="MARK">pretty straightforward to figure
					out</strong>&#x2014;just run the
					numbers&#x2014;and <strong class="MARK"
					>pretty indisputable in terms of its
					result.</strong>
				Plainly speaking, in this relationship, I was
					<strong class="MARK">putting a lot of labour
					and material resources in,</strong> but not
					<strong class="MARK">getting much in the way
					of care or support out.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				As a matter of fact, as I thought more about what I
					experienced over the past several months, the
					more I realized it had <strong class="MARK"
					>followed the same pattern I had grown
					familiar with</strong> from my time in
					Mastodon development:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Present a
							problem.</strong></strong>
						It <strong class="MARK">wasn't hard to
							notice,</strong> when our
							relationship began, that <strong
							class="MARK">things were not
							good.</strong>
						My partner had zero stability in their
							life, and it was clear that, if
							things were to have any hope of
							working out in the long&#x2010;term,
							that would have to change.
						As unconditional as love may be,
							<strong class="MARK">relationships
							are built upon care,</strong> and
							care requires means.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK">As the material
							conditions for my partner
							improved,</strong> however, the
							problems in our relationship, if
							anything, <strong class="MARK">got
							worse.</strong>
						I am not one to <em>ever</em> tell
							someone going through a rough time
							that their problems might be
							self&#x2010;generated.
						But it was frustrating, time after time,
							watching my loved one in one breath
							<strong class="MARK">pointedly
							mistreating others</strong> and
							<strong class="MARK">pushing them
							away,</strong> and in the very next
							<strong class="MARK">complaining
							about abandonment</strong> and
							<strong class="MARK">being so
							alone.</strong>
						And this dynamic led to me being their
							<strong class="MARK">primary and
							sole caretaker</strong> again and
							again.

						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Extract
							labour.</strong></strong>
						<strong class="MARK">Nobody should ever
							try to fix a person.</strong>
						The whole idea is <strong class="MARK"
							>flawed from the start</strong
							>&#x2014;that a person could be
							<i class="SO-CALLED">broken</i> and
							moreöver that you, <strong
							class="MARK">a completely untrained
							volunteer caretaker,</strong> might
							have the skills needed to <i
							class="SO-CALLED">fix</i> them.
						It is <strong class="MARK"
							>objectifying,</strong> it <strong
							class="MARK">leads to
							codependency,</strong> and it's
							<strong class="MARK">harmful for
							everybody involved.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						But <strong class="MARK">it is not
							unreasonable</strong> to try to fix
							<strong class="MARK">a shitty
							situation.</strong>
						Repairing friendships, acquiring
							employment, getting housing:
						<strong class="MARK">These are things
							one can do.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						And <strong class="MARK">these are things
							we,</strong> for the most part,
							<strong class="MARK"
							>achieved:</strong>
						I helped my partner <strong class="MARK"
							>get back in touch</strong> with
							those with whom they had become
							estranged.
						I helped them <strong class="MARK">make
							plans</strong> and <strong
							class="MARK">imagine a
							future</strong> with stability.
						I <strong class="MARK">listened to them
							vent</strong> about their
							job&#x2010;search, I <strong
							class="MARK">checked in</strong> as
							they made flights for interviews and
							looked for housing, I <strong
							class="MARK">drove on little sleep
							to go meet them</strong> before
							they made their final trip to their
							new city and apartment.
						And they, for their part, and not without
							the help of many others, <strong
							class="MARK">persevered,</strong>
							and made it happen.
						In a frankly remarkable series of events,
							over the course of the first half of
							the year, <strong class="MARK"
							>nearly every material
							concern</strong> they had begun our
							relationship with was resolved, and
							honestly, and with no hint of irony,
							<strong class="MARK">kudos to
							everyone involved.</strong>
					</p>
				</li>

					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Generate
							burnout.</strong></strong>
						At the same time, <strong class="MARK"
							>my needs weren't being met at
							all.</strong>
						I was <strong class="MARK"
							>on&#x2010;call essentially
							24/7</strong> to lend a helping hand
							in case a moment of crisis should
							arive; I was <strong class="MARK"
							>sitting in on phone calls</strong>
							and <strong class="MARK">serving as
							mediator</strong> as they tried
							unsuccessfully to repair
							relationships with people they had
							harmed; I had to be conscious to
							<strong class="MARK">always keep
							them in my thoughts</strong> and
							<strong class="MARK">check in
							regularly</strong> to keep their
							fears of abandonment down.
						I was, essentially, a <strong
							class="MARK">full&#x2010;time
							caretaker,</strong> only lacking
							both the training and the income
							which that position usually
							provides.
					</p>
					<p>
						Needless to say, my <strong class="MARK"
							>work on Mastodon,</strong> my
							<strong class="MARK">work on other
							projects,</strong> and basically
							<strong class="MARK">everything
							else happening in my life</strong
							>&#x2014;which nobody's
							life depended on, which I could
							<i class="SO-CALLED">afford</i> (in
							the literal sense, because I was
							losing time and resources as a
							result) to <i class="SO-CALLED"
							>slack off</i> on&#x2010;<strong
							class="MARK">suffered as a
							result.</strong>
						And, for the most part, <strong
							class="MARK">I made these sacrifices
							willingly,</strong> because they
							were for somebody I loved.
					</p>
					<p>
						Eventually, however&#x2014;after we had
							successfully met their material
							needs, after my constant labour
							looked like it wasn't going to be
							needed anymore&#x2014;I finally made
							the call: that this relationship
							pattern, which had been necessary,
							but which we had <strong
							class="MARK">both known from the
							getgo wasn't sustainable</strong>,
							had run its course.
						It is my opinon, based upon personal
							experience, that <strong
							class="MARK">it is not possible to
							always simultaneöusly be someone's
							caretaker and romantic
							partner</strong>&#x2014;one or the
							other will sometimes have to give.
						For most of our relationship, <strong
							class="MARK">beïng able to provide
							care was more important than
							romance.</strong>
						Now that things were looking up, I was
							<strong class="MARK">looking to
							transition out of that caretaker
							role.</strong>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Create
							drama.</strong></strong>
						<q>I feel like you <strong class="MARK"
							>don't really treat me like a
							girlfriend,</strong></q> I told my
							partner (paraphrased), on one
							occasion.
						<q>I feel like you <strong class="MARK"
							>show more affection to strangers on
							the internet</strong> than you do
							with me.
						I know I'm an anxious person
							but&#x2014;do you think you could
							<strong class="MARK">accommodate
							that a little</strong> and do a
							better job of <strong class="MARK"
							>affirming the ways in which you
							love me?</strong></q>
					</p>
					<p>
						I've gotta be honest with you on this
							one&#x2014;I <strong class="MARK"
							>really thought that this request
							would be no big deal.</strong>
						<q>Of course you're my girlfriend; what
							can I do to make things easier for
							you?</q>&#x2014;nevermind the fact
							that <strong class="MARK">never
							<em>once</em> in the six months of
							our relationship</strong> had they
							asked whether they were <strong
							class="MARK">doing an okay job as a
							partner</strong> or if there was
							<strong class="MARK">anything they
							could be doing better,</strong>
							despite me being very conscious
							about asking those very questions
							to them multiple times each month.
						I really thought we could <strong
							class="MARK">talk this out,</strong>
							maybe <strong class="MARK">go over
							love languages</strong> and <strong
							class="MARK">differential ways of
							expressing care,</strong> and things
							would get better and the whole
							matter would be resolved.
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead, I was told that my <strong
							class="MARK">asking for
							accommodations was
							out&#x2010;of&#x2010;line,</strong>
							that it was <strong class="MARK"
							>my problem for never feeling
							valued</strong> despite <strong
							class="MARK">never being given
							anything of value;</strong>
							furthermore, that trying to have a
							conversation about these things was
							<strong class="MARK">too much for
							them to handle right now.</strong>
						We didn't speak for a week after that.
					</p>
					<p>
						I <strong class="MARK">don't see it as
							any sort of coïncidence</strong>
							that me asserting my needs became
							<i class="SO-CALLED">too much to
							handle</i> the moment I stopped
							letting my partner be <strong
							class="MARK">dependent on me for
							their care.</strong>
						The moment my labour stopped being an
							exploitable resource, my presence
							<strong class="MARK">became a
							nuisance</strong> and <strong
							class="MARK">painful reminder of
							trauma</strong> which <strong
							class="MARK">begged for vitriolic
							detatchment.</strong>
						Our relationship <strong class="MARK"
							>degraded quickly from
							there.</strong>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong class="MARK"><strong>Discard and
							repeat.</strong></strong>
						When my partner and I got back in
							contact, we both pledged to take
							time out of our days to have a long
							conversation, where we would <strong
							class="MARK">air out our fears and
							feelings and work to sort through
							them.</strong>
						It was a very good idea and I went into
							it with the hope that we would, if
							nothing else, at least be able to
							<strong class="MARK">nurture a good
							friendship</strong> out of the ashes
							of what we had gone through.
					</p>
					<p>
						After we had been talking long enough for
							them to express all of their <em
							>own</em> feelings on the matter,
							however, my partner determined that
							the conversations were <strong
							class="MARK">taking too much time
							and energy out of their
							weeks,</strong> that <strong
							class="MARK">listening to my
							concerns was distracting from their
							ability to perform at their
							job,</strong> and they essentially
							<strong class="MARK">called the
							whole thing off</strong> and broke
							up with me.
						<span class="PARENTHETICAL">(NB:
						Our relationship was not healthy.
						I hold nothing against them for calling
							it off.
						But the way in which they were
							enthusiastic about our conversations
							only so long as they served their
							own purposes was indicative of how
							our relationship had tended to go as
							a whole.)</span>
						We tried being <i class="SO-CALLED">just
							friends</i>&#x2014;that lasted
							<strong class="MARK">until I tried
							holding them accountable</strong>
							for all of the times they had used
							me over the past year.
						Then it was <strong class="MARK"><q
							>goodbye, kibi.</q></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						I muted them after that, so, in all
							honesty, I can't speak to the
							<i class="SO-CALLED">repeat</i> part
							of this step.
						But I do know that I was <strong
							class="MARK">far from the first
							person</strong> they had treated in
							this way.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				I've <strong class="MARK">left out a number of
					details</strong> in the above narrative:
				<strong class="MARK">Red flags</strong> that I
					should have paid more attention to; <strong
					class="MARK">moments of manipulation;</strong
					> small and large <strong class="MARK"
					>violations of boundaries and consent;</strong
					> numerous questionable <strong class="MARK"
					>interactions with others;</strong> attempts
					to <strong class="MARK">discredit my voice
					and control the narrative.</strong>
				But <strong class="MARK">dwelling on these
					traumas</strong> will likely <strong
					class="MARK">not make anything better for
					anyone,</strong> and a Mastodon history
					series is hardly the place to be <strong
					class="MARK">unreservedly dishing the salt on
					your ex.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, I bring this up because it was <strong
					class="MARK">really frightening for
					me</strong> to realize that the <strong
					class="MARK">unhealthy treatment of
					caretakers</strong> and <strong class="MARK"
					>exploitation of labour</strong> which I had
					become so accustomed to in Mastodon
					development had also characterized my private
					affairs.
				To realize that <strong class="MARK">this had
					become my normal,</strong> not just in the
					workplace, but in my intimate relationships as
					well.
				To acknowledge that <strong class="MARK">this
					problem was cultural,</strong> that <strong
					class="MARK">Mastodon encouraged it;</strong>
					to wonder to what extent <strong class="MARK"
					>Mastodon was being conditioned for
					it,</strong> and how many other people were
					<strong class="MARK">walking into this sort of
					trap;</strong> and, most frighening of all,
					realizing that I wasn't entirely certain that
					<strong class="MARK">people would see the
					problem</strong> if I was public and open
					about my experiences, that I wasn't entirely
					certain that <strong class="MARK">I even knew
					what the problem was <em>myself</em>,</strong
					> because I had been living this for so long,
					because I had been living <em>in</em> this
					for so long, that I <strong class="MARK"
					>didn't know what was reasonable</strong> to
					expect from people anymore.
			</p>
			<p>
				With respect to the rest of this history series:
				It is undeniable that my involvement in this
					relationship had <strong class="MARK">a
					profound impact on my ability to contribute
					to Mastodon development,</strong> as well as
					on <strong class="MARK">the shape in which
					those contributions took place.</strong>
				As is true for my professional relationships and
					all the other caretaker roles I have served in
					during my time on Mastodon.
				There will be plenty of time to get into the
					details regarding those contributions in the
					posts which follow this one.
			</p>
			<p>
				But for now:
				We <strong class="MARK">need to have a conversation
					about this.</strong>
				We need to <strong class="MARK">radically rethink
					the way we approach care</strong> and really
					<strong class="MARK">interrogate the ways in
					which we are complicit</strong> in the
					continued exploitation of our caretakers.
				We need to <strong class="MARK">stop providing
					solace to exploiters and abusers,</strong>
					<strong class="MARK">stop ignoring or
					normalizing toxic relationship patterns and
					abuse,</strong> and <strong class="MARK"><em
					>start</em> modelling healthy relationships
					and ways of beïng with one another.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				It seems like every week there is someone else
					venting on their timeline about an ex who took
					advantage of them and treated them like shit.
				It's honestly exhausting living in a community
					where that seems so regular and normal.
				<strong class="MARK">We need to do more</strong> to
					<strong class="MARK">protect our fellow
					fediversians,</strong> <strong class="MARK"
					>respect their boundaries,</strong> and
					<strong class="MARK">ensure that the care
					that they provide is sustainable.</strong>
				And we need to start <strong class="MARK">valuïng
					people based on what they have done for our
					community</strong> and not whether or not they
					are good at making fucking trashtoots.
