		I consider this playlist to be the spiritual sibling to last
			week's mixtape, <a
			href="https://www.u2764.com/MXTP/2018-09-24/dot-support/"
			><cite>dot support</cite></a>.
		It is also a rerelease of a mix I created while I was in
			college, and has a somewhat&#x2010;<i class="SO-CALLED"
			>future</i> feel to it (hence the name), in an almost
			nostalgic 2000s sort of way.
		See the table below for a track listing and information on
			each of the songs.

						We start off with the opening track from

							Learning to Manage Chaos</cite>.
						All of <cite>Dysfunctional Systems</cite

						<cite>16 Years</cite> was made available

						tryad is one of those obscure indie
							free&#x2010;culture artists that I
							came across in 2012 when I was deep
							in my Creative Commons&#x2013;phase.
						Their songs have that subtle mix of
							positivity and depression that was

							of college, and I had some of their
							tracks basically on repeat.
					</p>
					<p>
						I like to think of tryad as basically
							what 2005 thought 2015 might sound
							like.
						They were pretty wrong, but still.

					<p>
						The White Panda's mashup tapes were
							what I would always listen to
							whenever I was
							programming&#x2014;because, for the
							most part, they were irredeemable
							trash, but irredeemable trash in the
							way that has a nice beat and gets
							you pumped and you don't have to
							think too hard about when you're
							trying to implement a big messy
							algorithm in a programming
							language you're not really fluënt
							in anyway.
						This set that they ran for the Firefly
							Music Festival in 2013 is…
							legitimately one of their best
							works?
						It's amazing to me that this fits the
							#mood of the mix as well as it does,
							considering, but damn if it doesn't
							though.
						(The beat and synths also set us up for
							our next track, which is important.)

						See also <a

							been a runner&#x2010;up for this

						This is also the point of transition out

						The fade&#x2010;out on <cite

							opportunity to roll back our
							escalation and take things down a
							notch again.
						This track reminds me of Andreas
							Vollenweider's <cite>Book of
							Roses</cite>, which I listened to a
							lot as a kid, only instead of New
							Age it's Japanese
							sample&#x2010;based electronica.
						It builds a really good atmosphere and
							sets the stage for our <em>next</em>
							track…

						This is the song that plays as you're

						Yeah.
						It's that track.

						In my defense, <cite>Mass Effect</cite>
							is definitely set in the future.

						Continuïng our theme of dark, futuristic

						The Lights Galaxia is another Creative

						Their netlabel, <a href="

						<em>Yes</em>, this is another Metroid
							remix, but it's Theophany and good
							and this is a future&#x2010;themed
							playlist anyway, so I don't care.
						This is a <em>very different</em> take
							on the Maridia theme from three
							tracks ago, and serves as a nice
							reprise to the whole thing, as well
							as a transition away from the
							emotional intensity of the middle of
							this tape and towards the
							contemplative mood that makes up the
							end.

						<em>Finally</em>, an upbeat happy song!
						This is the final track to <cite

						This is the final track to <cite>Digital:
