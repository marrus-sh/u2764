		In college, I was depressed and anxious a <em>lot</em>.
		This is re&#x2010;release of playlist I made during that time
			to help me calm down and lift my spirits and feel
			a little bit better.
		It's 40% anime and videogame music and 60% other songs which
			hold special significance for me.
		See the table below for a track listing and information on
			each of the songs.

					<p>
						Another Studio Ghibli track!
						This one is the theme song to the English
							version of <cite>Kiki's Delivery
							Service</cite>.
						More significantly for me, however, it
							was the theme song for <a
							href="https://youtu.be/MaCoz_Q0pzo"
							>the <em>advertisement</em> for
							<cite>Kiki's Delivery Service</cite
							></a> which played at the beginning
							of the VHS tape for Disney's <cite
							>The Black Cauldron</cite>.
						I didn't know anything about Studio
							Ghibli or anime as a kid, but I did
							watch <cite>The Black Cauldron</cite
							> a lot, and I loved that
							advertisement.
						Of course, it failed as a piece of
							marketing, because I never thought
							to actually ask my parents to buy
							<cite>Kiki's Delivery Service</cite>
							as a Thing To Watch.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I actually <em>did</em> watch <cite
							>Kiki's Delivery Service</cite> for
							the first time, many years later, it
							was a Blu&#x2010;ray release which
							used the Japanese theme song
							instead.
						So I still associate this track more with
							that old advertisement than with the
							actual movie, lol.

						Is it weird to put a song about a murder
							on a positive, uplifting playlist?
						Maybe, but I'm doing it anyway.
						Even if it is dark, I love the hopeful
							optimism that runs through Nanna's
							lines in this song, and it's one of
							my favourites from OMAM's first
							album.
						(OMAM songs, in general, are pretty much
							guaranteed to make me feel better,

						I purchased <cite>Dysfunctional Systems:

						It has an amazing soundtrack and some

						In elementary school, my brother and I

							of <cite>Annie</cite> was a CD we

						(I think I was more into it than he was,

						This track comes from the B&#x2010;side
							of the CD&#x2014;which is honestly,
							in my opinion, the stronger side,
							since it mostly just consists of
							Charles Strouse singing demos and
							giving you a rundown of the play.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyway, <cite>Tomorrow</cite> is <em

							mood&#x2010;uplifting song, so I
							had to include it here in some form.

						<cite>Bleach</cite> is a very good anime
							(or, at least the first three
							seasons of <cite>Bleach</cite> are a
							good anime&#x2014;<cite>Bleach</cite
							> is long).
						If you ever read me writing a fight
							scene (which doesn't happen often
							because I mostly write romance but),
							chances are I watched like five
							episodes of <cite>Bleach</cite>
							right before it to get a feel for
							the pacing.
						This song is the sixth ending theme to be
							used on the series, and it's
							delightfully energetic and
							uplifting.
						I also absolutely love the transition
							from the slow, contemplative, lowfi
							feel of <cite>Tomorrow</cite> into
							the loud and upbeat mood here.

						It's a <em>really good</em> rap song

					</p>
					<p>
						Sun Zoo holds special relevance to me

https://archive.org/download/BSCOMP0005B/10-SunZoo-TheDaoofSunZoo.mp3"
							><cite>The Dao of Sun Zoo ft. DJ

http://www.browndailyherald.com/2007/02/16/custer-08-drops-new-rap-album-today/
">this article about him in the <cite>Brown Daily Herald</cite></a>.
						His first album, <cite>Hope Flies</cite>
							is available for download <a href="
https://archive.org/details/CantSeeTheForest">through the Internet
							Archive</a>, but the only way to get
							the second and third in modern
							times, as far as I'm aware, is via

						But, uh.
						Good luck finding seeds or peers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thankfully for the purposes of this

							>Roads On The Earth</cite> was

							with a somewhat unfortunate
