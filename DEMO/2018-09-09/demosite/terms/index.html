        <p>
            <strong>This is not a legal document.</strong>
            However, it outlines the rules and restrictions that <u>GLASS<sub>CAFE</sub></u> abides by, and violations of these terms may lead to administrative action, including bans.
            <strong>By using our service, you agree:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><mark>To uphold our <u><a href="../principles/index.html" target="_self">Principles</a></u>.</mark> People who post content which is in severe violation of our <u>Principles</u>, including but not limited to content which is racist or sexist in nature, may be banned from our service. Abusive behaviour will not be tolerated and will result in a ban. (If you do not agree with our <u>Principles</u>, you should probably not sign up for an account on our site.)</li>
            <li><mark>To follow the law.</mark> Breaking the law, including by posting illegal content, threatens our service and its users. By using our service you agree to follow the laws of the United States (where we are) and the country in which you reside.</li>
            <li><mark>To appropriately tag content.</mark> Content which is sexually explicit or which contains gore <strong>must</strong> be tagged. This includes overt textual descriptions of said content. Images or videos which contain this material <strong>must</strong> be marked as sensitive.</li>
            <li><mark>Not to spam the public timeline.</mark> Our definition of <q>spam</q> includes uncurated newsbots and excessive (to the extent that it is a detriment to other users' experience) advertising. Novelty bots are fine so long as they don't post more than once per hour, although consider making bots post in an unlisted manner instead.</li>
